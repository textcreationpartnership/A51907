            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Then I ſaid I will not make mention of him, nor ſpeak any more in his name:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 20.9.</note> 
                     <hi>but his word was in my heart as a burning fire ſhut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not ſtay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some carnall men do confeſſe that it is true that we muſt preach the judgments of God againſt ſin, that is our trade; but let children fear thoſe bugbears, they know as well as we can tell them that God is mercifull, and his mercy is above all his works.</p>
                  <p>It is true that we muſt preach judgment againſt ſin, for we have fear of the burthen of all thoſe ſins of others which we reprove not, to fall upon our ſelves.</p>

                  <p>For the Prophets of the Lord and his holy Miniſters, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſins which they do daily reprove to come up ſo faſt, as though they had never layd the axe of Gods judgment againſt the root of that corrupt tree; the zeal of Gods glory ſo ſtirreth them that they cannot hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And ſo long as we reprove juſtly, and mingle none of our own heat with the fire of Gods altar, we ſhall kindle a fire in the bones of the ſinner which ſhall give him no reſt, but his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall ſay to him as <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid to <hi>David.

                  <p>We ſhall find as ſoone as we are paſt this firſt <hi>verſe,</hi> that this Prophet did feel the burthen which he did ſee; and the griefe he took for them, turned his Harp into mourning, and his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes into the voyce of them that weep; every tender heart avoydeth being a meſſenger of evil news, but their feet be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull that bring glad tydings, tydings of peace.</p>

                  <p>They that truly fear God, when they hear their ſins threatned, do retire themſelves into their chambers, they weep and deplore their iniquities. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> hearing the Prophet threatning his life</p>

                  <p>Never think that you hear the threatnings of God with any profit till you feel the burthen of them oppreſſing, and the edge of them drawing bloud on you. <hi>Lachrymae</hi> be <hi>ſanguis animae.</hi>

                  <p>To give ſome light to that which followeth, let me firſt admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you that it may well be gathered, by the title that is here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Habakkuk</hi> the Prophet, that he was ſent by Almighty God to preach to the Iews to reclaim them from their evil wayes, and to ſtill the noiſe of their crying ſinnes: and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing with them, to bring them to repentance, he prayeth and cryeth to Almighty God for his judgement upon this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to puniſh their many ſins: and God not hearing him, nor giving way to his anger to correct them, the Prophet moved with the zeal of Gods glory, wraſtleth with God, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with him for his rod upon them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What the Prophet did.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I cry,</hi> he lifteth up his voice againſt this People his brethren; for it is twice expreſt. 1. <hi>He cryeth;</hi> then he reſumeth it, he ſaith, <hi>he cryeth out;</hi> this is a thing that God doth uſe to take ſpecial notice of, <hi>expectavi Justitiam &amp; ecce clamor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Abel,</hi> that being dead he ſpake; <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, it was <hi>voxſanguinis,</hi> a voice of blood, &amp; God ſaid that voice cryed to him out of the earth for vengeance.</p>
                  <p>The Cry of a Prophet one of Gods Secretaries, to whom he revealeth his will; one of Gods Chaplains, to whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth the Miniſtry of the Revelation of his will; one of Gods Saviours, to whom he committeth the office of ſaving his People; the crying, the vociferation of one of Gods Seers, who cries not out of paſſion or humane perturbation, but from a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret inſpiration illuminating him and ſhewing him things to come;</p>
                  <p>One of Gods holy ones whom the zeale of Gods glory doth inflame with this earneſtneſſe, the grief of mans rebellion doth provoke to that loudneſſe. Such a cry cannot ſpend it ſelf all into aire and Sunne, and periſh with the noiſe it makes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He was no Sonne of thunder to make ſome ſuddain ratling
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104898:18"/>noiſe, and then ceaſe. He cryed loud, he cryed long, <hi>How long ſhall I cry?</hi> if the weakneſſe of his voice could not penet rate the eare of God <hi>vi</hi> by force, here was <hi>ſaepe cadendo,</hi> by often falling. So <hi>David</hi> got an hoarſeneſſe in throat with crying loud and long to the Lord; and our Saviour hath commanded that kind of importunity in Prayer, and the Prophet will give God no reſt till he heare and anſwer; for the Prayer of the juſt, if it be fervent, prevaileth with God: zeale is an holy fire, the flame of it aſcendeth to heaven, and penetrateth all the paſſages till it come to God. Cold and perfunctory devotions intermitted and given over, do not prevaile with God; they pleaſe him beſt that uſe moſt violence, for the kingdome of heaven ſuffereth <hi>violence.</hi>

                  <p>But the cry of the Prophet went up to God, who beholdeth ungodlineſſe and wrong, that he may take the matter into his own hand.</p>

                  <p>For <hi>violence;</hi> this is fully and largely expreſt in the ſecond part of his conteſtation with God, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>I therefore only obſerve here two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he complained not without great provocation, for <hi>violence</hi> was Gods own complaint and quarrel againſt the old world. <hi>The earth is full of violence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 6.13</note>

                  <p>It was Gods quarrel againſt <hi>Edom,</hi> for thy <hi>violence</hi> againſt thy brother <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſhame ſhall cover thee,<note place="margin">Obad. 10.</note> and thou ſhalt be cut off for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We conſider where this <hi>violence</hi> was; not of <hi>Eſau</hi> againſt <hi>Iacob,</hi> but of <hi>Iacob</hi> againſt <hi>Iacob,</hi> as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> deſcribeth it:</p>
                  <p>Every man eating the fleſh of his own arme, <hi>Manaſſeh E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Civil and Domeſtick warres in the boſome of the Church, grievances and vexations one of another: theſe differences it is likely that the Prophets had laboured to compound, and uſed all meanes to ſettle Peace there, but it appeareth that they prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, therefore he complaineth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>With what Succeſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Thou wilt not hear;</hi> the Cry of the Prophet was to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the Iuſtice of God, to chaſten his People for this <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</hi> for ſo deſperate was the diſeaſe of the Church, that they needed the ſharpeſt Phyſick to heal it, even the rod of God to correct them.</p>
                  <p>Yet God is ſo ſlow to wrath, and ſo long-ſuffering, that he would not hearken to the voice of his Prophets as yet, to pull his hand out of his boſome, though they ſaid with <hi>David, It is time for thee Lord to put to thine hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Thou wilt not ſave.</hi> 1. Thou wilt not ſuccour them that ſuffer <hi>violence</hi> againſt the hand of their oppreſſours; as his not hearing is to be imputed to his mercy and patience, ſo his not ſaving is to be imputed either to his wiſedome, putting his children to the trial of their faith by afflictions; or to his Juſtice, making one of them who have corrupted their wayes a rod to ſcourge the other, neither of them being as yet worth the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, till he had humbled them.</p>
                  <p>The text thus cleared, the doctrines which grow upon this ſtemme and firſt branch of the Prophets conteſtation are theſe.</p>

                     <item>4. That God ſometimes ſuſpendeth the deſired ſucceſſe of the earneſt Prayers of his moſt faithful ſervants, when they do pray according to his will, and doth not heare them by and by.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>I find that this People, to whom God had ſent his Prophets riſing early and ſending them, were grown incorrigible: and therefore even the Prophets that loved them, and wiſhed them well, having no other way to reform them, were now put to it to pray againſt their violence to God. They that had wont to ſtand in the gap, to turn away ingruent judgements, do take ſuch offence at their ungodlineſſe, that they are put to it to pray to God againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Ioſeph</hi> carried the evil report of his brethren to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made them to be ſhent, wherein he did a brotherly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſeek their Reformation.</p>

If all theſe ſupports which we do owe to our brother will not keep him up, then let him be as an heathen, and then is <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer in ſeaſon.</p>

                  <p>This is commonly the war between the ſuperiour and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, between the ſtrong and the weak; for the weakeſt here go to the wall.</p>
                  <p>Theſe be ſignes of a drooping and decaying common-wealth, when cruelty and violence is its own carver, and the poor have their faces ground between the tearing milſtones of oppreſſion: when the poor flock pines and ſtarves with hunger. When,</p>

                     <hi>Alienas oves cuſtos bis mulget in hora.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For they be called <hi>filii alieni,</hi> ſtrange children that do oppreſſe their brethren. When things are not carried by the Law of Juſtice, but by the power of violence.</p>
                  <p>And the common-wealth of the Jewes were even ſick to the death of this diſeaſe, at this time when <hi>Habakkuk</hi> prophecied; for ſhortly after followed their deportation, and the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and deſolation of the Temple.</p>
                  <p>Let all the Kingdomes of the world take warning by this fearfull example, and let not private perſons tranſgreſſing in this kinde, forget what the Lord did to this people.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Prophet addeth <hi>Before me:</hi> wherein he declareth a double boldneſſe of theſe ſinners.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they profeſſed their oppoſition, and cared not who ſaw it; for the holy men of God ſearch not ſo deep into the manners of men to ſeek out their faults; neither do they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelves ſtudents in the affaires of the common-wealth as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104898:24"/>to obſerve how things are carried; but if God declare it to them, and cauſe them to behold it, and if the workers of this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be ſo bold and open that they care not who ſee it, this doth prove the ſinne deeply rooted and high-grown in amongſt them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It proves their boldneſſe in ſinning, that they durſt commit thoſe crying ſins before the Prophet the meſſenger of God ſent of purpoſe to reprove them, and coming from Almighty God to diſſwade them from it.</p>
                  <p>Sinne at firſt is baſhfull and modeſt, and doth fear the ſight of any good man. <hi>Seneca</hi> the learned Preacher thought it a good thing to keep in unruly deſires, and any intemperancy in young men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prodeſt ſine dubio cuſtodem ſibi impoſuiſſe &amp; habere quem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicias:</hi> And to live</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tanquam ſub alicujus boni viri ſemper praeſentis oculis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when men grow to that height of ſinning, that they dare commit their iniquities in the ſight of God, and men; in the ſight of the Miniſter that carrieth the ſword of Gods Spirit, the word of God to reprove it and threaten it, or in the ſight of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate that carrieth the ſword of God to puniſh it, then to uſe the Apoſtles word, <hi>Sin is out of meaſure ſinfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such are they that ſwear and blaſpheme the name of God, that talk ſcurrilouſly and leudly, that deprave their brethren ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly, that drink drunk even before us the Miniſters of Gods word, as if God had ſent us to bid them ſin on, and as if we had no commiſſion to find fault out of the Pulpit.</p>
                  <p>They ſave their own ſtakes by confining us to the Pulpit, and ſhutting up our power there; for there they know we may not tax perſonally, and they think themſelvs free enough if we ſmite at ſin only in generall terms; for ſuch reproofes have no edge but what parricular application doth give them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are wiſe enough to favour themſelves.</p>
                  <p>It is not nothing that the Prophet doth ſay that this <hi>ſpoyling</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> was done before him; for his words of reproof will prove them guilty of wilfull tranſgreſſion and contempt of the divine Majeſty, as it preſently followeth.</p>
                  <p>And he will be both a fearfull imprecator againſt them as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104898:24"/>he proveth in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> to call down Gods judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; and he will be a full witneſſe to teſtifie againſt them before God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And there are that raiſe up ſtrife and contention.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a further complaint of the Prophet againſt this people that they are ſo farre from peace, that they do pick quarrels one with another, and make matter of <hi>strife</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is contrarie to the Apoſtles precept.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as in you is,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>There be ſome of that froward nature, and wrangling diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that cannot contain themſelves within the bounds of peace, but they muſt be ever ſearching where they may finde fault, thinking it beſt fiſhing in troubled waters.</p>
                  <p>You ſee that God taketh notice of ſuch unquiet perſons, and detecteth them to his Prophets that they may chide them for it as the Apoſtle ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now I beſeech you brethren marke them which cauſe diviſions and offences.</hi> You ſee God marketh them,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.17.</note> for it is one of the ſix things which God abhorres, him that ſoweth diſcord among brethren.<note place="margin">Pro. 6.19.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is great cauſe why God ſhould abhorre ſuch as ſtirre up ſtrife.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe God is called the God of peace, and his Goſpel is called the Goſpel of peace, and his naturall Sonne became <hi>Pax noſtra,</hi> our peace; and his adopted Sonnes be children of peace.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thoſe ſonnes of thunder, thoſe boyſtrous and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous natures muſt needs be abominable to him whoſe wayes be <hi>viae pacis,</hi> the wayes of peace; for contraries do expell one the other.</p>
                  <p>Contention doth derive it ſelf from two very offenſive cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in men which are abominable to God, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſheweth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Only by pride commeth contention;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 13.12</note> and indeed they that think themſelves wiſer then their brethren, and overween the graces of God in themſelves, and think themſelves worthy to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104898:25"/>ſit at the helme and to direct all, if they cannot have their own wils in every thing, then they quarrell, and contend with all that oppoſe them.</p>
                  <p>The proud man God reſiſteth, for he encrocheth upon his ſoveraingty; therefore <hi>David</hi> ſayeth that God abhorreth him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hatred ſtirreth up ſtrife;<note place="margin">Prov. 10.12.</note> that is another corruption in man which God cannot diſpenſe with, becauſe he is charity; and only he which dwelleth in charity, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</p>
                  <p>There be many diſtaſtes and diſlikes that do grow even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt friends, becauſe we either want the wiſedom to know, or the patience to conſider when time is, that there can be no peace between us except we can bear with one another, and forgive one another ſome infirmities, which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>bearing one anothers burthens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not that ſinne of infirmity in our nature that is here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, but when men be ſo perverſe and unquiet that they will ſtirre up ſtrife and contention; as <hi>David</hi> complaineth, <hi>They ſtirre up ſtrife all the day long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when there is not only contention, as in thoſe that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly work one againſt another, but there is <hi>Jurgium</hi> a chiding and ſcolding too; and that they go ſo farre in it, that when the Prophet ſpeaketh to them of peace, they prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to battail; this is hoſtility to peace.</p>
                  <p>Here all thoſe that diſquiet the peace of their brethren, by ſecret whiſpers and by open detractions; and all thoſe that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt one another in needleſſe ſuits of law, all talebearers that carry fire about them to enflame a brother againſt a brother, do ſee who takes notice of them; even God himſelf; and they make the Prophets and Miniſters of God like <hi>Joſeph</hi> to carry their evil report to their father: and to complain of them as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies unto peace;</p>
                  <p>All thoſe that when a contention is layd aſleep, do awak it with new ſuggeſtions, and ſtirre it up a freſh, and put fewel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:104898:25"/>The Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>That if we be led by the Spirit of God, we are the ſonnes of God.</hi> But it is clear that contention and ſtrife and debate are fruits of the fleſh, and declare us to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; and fleſh and bloud cannot inherite the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe contentions do make us unfit for the ſervice of God, and to performe all Chriſtian offices to one another; and God ſeeing it for the good of his people, he detecteth it to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of purpoſe, that they may ſeek Reformation thereof. But theſe did ſtrive even with the Prophets.</p>

                     <hi>Therefore the Law is ſlacked.</hi>

                     <hi>and was grieved becauſe they kept not thy word;</hi> this complaint then was no humane perturbation, but a ſad compaint for the injury done to Almighty God in his Law.</p>
                  <p>And herein we ſhew our zeal of Gods glory when we are moved and troubled at the contempt of his Law; for common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are full of hear and provocation in perſonall injuries when our ſelves are touched: but we are too cold in the quarrell of God.</p>
                  <p>The holy Pſalmiſt cryes out, <hi>Away from me all ye that work ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitiy, for I will keep the Commandments of my God.</hi> This is to be angry without ſin, when we are provoked againſt them that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the holy Law of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Note how licentiouſneſſe was overgrown in this people, and to what an height there ſin was come up; when the Law of God which was by God given to them, depoſited with them, given with ſuch a charge of keeping it, with ſuch terrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings

                  <p>Prayer is a pouring forth of the heart to God, wherein we proſtrate all our deſires to God, and crave his help.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes we call to remembrance the mercies of God, and ſumme up his benefits, which though it be joyned with prayer, and doth paſſe under the name of prayer, yet is it rather a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and diſtinct part of Gods worſhip in it ſelf, then properly any member or part of prayer.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes we begge of God ſupply of our wants, and that we call <hi>Petition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes we plead the cauſe of our brethren and begge for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is <hi>Interceſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes we pray againſt judgment and ſin, and that is <hi>Deprecation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes we have cauſe to complain to God of the ſins and tranſgreſſions of our brethren, when either the honour of God, or the peace of brethren is violated: ſo here; this is <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For when we ſee that the outward means of reclaiming men from giving offence to God, to the Church and to Chriſtian Religion, do not work effectually to reforme them; yet we muſt not forſake the cauſe of God ſo, but make our complaint unto him, and put the matter into his hand.</p>
                  <p>Thus when there was a councel held againſt the Apoſtles;<note place="margin">Act. 4.</note> and therein conſultation for the quenching of the light of the Goſpel then beginning to ſhine more clearly,<note place="margin">Verſ. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> went aſide from the councel, diſmiſſed with a ſtraight and ſevere charge to ſpeak no more in that name.</p>
                  <p>They came to their brethren and informed them of theſe things; and <hi>They lifted up their voice to God with one accord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 24.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In that prayer they complain of their enemies. 1. For that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104898:28"/>which they had done already: <hi>For of a truth againſt thy holy child</hi> Jeſus <hi>whom thou haſt anointed, both</hi> Herod, <hi>and</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>and the Gentiles were gathered together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For that which they meant to doe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And now Lord behold their threatnings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This alſo is twice included in the Lords Prayer; for when we deſire that the Kingdome of God may come, we do complain of the enemies of that Kingdome, and deſire God to ariſe and ſcatter them, and defeat all their deſignes againſt the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And when we pray not to be led into tempation, but to be delivered from evils, we do ſecretly complain of all thoſe evils which Satan and his wicked inſtruments do plot againſt the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church, or any particular members thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The reaſon is becauſe vengeance belongeth to God, and we muſt remember of what ſpirit we are, and muſt not take the quarrel of God into our hands, but leave it to God to ſee and require.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the times and ſeaſons are only in his power, and we muſt leave it to his wiſe Juſtice to take the fit time for the converſion or confuſion of his enemies, in the mean time reſting our ſelves on his ſure Protection and faithful care of us,</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Becauſe we may have enemies for the preſent, who may come to a ſight and ſenſe of their ſins, and may by our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of them to God, receive his ſaving mercy to reconcile them to the Church, as he did <hi>Saul</hi> at the Prayer of Saint <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> who ſhortly after became an Apoſtle, and proved a choſen Inſtrument of Gods Glory.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt complain of theſe things to declare our zeal of Gods Glory, and our holy impatience to ſee his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments deſpiſed of men.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To ſhew our charity to our brethren, who do ſuffer by this cruel and wicked world, whoſe eſtates we pitty, and we go to God as a common father to us all, to take the matter into his own hands.</p>
                  <p>From whence we conclude that it ever ought to be a part of our Prayer, to call upon the name of God by way of complaint of the iniquity of the times in which we do live, that God may give an end to it, and that it may not prevail againſt his Church,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104898:28"/>leaſt the enemies thereof do grow too proud.</p>
                  <p>This manner of complaining and calling upon God for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt the ungodly doth not die with us here; the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſouls parted from earth, and from their bodies do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſaw under the Altar the ſouls of them that were ſlain for the Word of God, and for the Teſtimony which they held.</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>This doctrine yieldeth this fruit of application to our profit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we ought to complain to God of the wickedneſſe of our brethren, when they do grow incorrigible, it is a fair warning to us to walk warily and with a good conſcience before God and man; and that in two reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we do not offend our brethren by any means, leaſt we give them occaſion to complain to God of us. It is a dangerous thing to give occaſion of offence to any of thoſe little ones that truſt in God, and wo be to them that give the offence.</p>
                  <p>It is the praiſe of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth:</hi>

                  <p>You ſhall find it a great contentment in your heart, and peace in your bones all your life through, but eſpecially upon your death-bed, when you can comfort your ſelves with this, that your brethren with whom you have lived, have had no cauſe to complain of you. But it will be an ornament to your memory, and a ſecond life to your good name when you are departed hence.</p>
                  <p>Let no man neglect the complaints of his brethren, eſpecially of Gods Miniſters; for where they be juſt they have ſwift paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and eaſie admittance, and moſt gracious auditors.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we do not ſo defile our ſelves with our ſinnes, that we may complain, and God will not heare us: for there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more that complain and are not heard, then of thoſe that

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe they impeach the authority and power of God, who hath reſerved to himſelf the diſpenſation of his own gifts here; for the earth is the Lords, and all that therein is, and he hath given it to the ſonnes of men; whatſoever either honour or wealth any man poſſeſſeth, which is not of his gift, that is atchei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by unlawfull means, it hath not his bleſſing, and it is held by intruſion and uſurpation.</p>
                  <p>He hath not put man into the world as he did the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Canaan</hi> to be his own carver, and to take what he can get by ſtrength or policy; they had warrant for what they did there, we have a law of reſtraint to confine us to lawfull wayes and means of living: therefore all ſuch violence as inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the goods of our brethren is a wrong to him who openeth his hand and filleth with plenty, and doth not bid us ariſe kill and eat, and get what we can, no matter how.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This uncharitable practice doth deſtroy ſociety, for ſeeing God for peace ſake, hath made a difference between men on earth, ſome ſuperiour, others inferiour: ſome rich, ſome poor, that there might be a need of one another, to maintaine the ſtate of a common-wealth; all they that ingroſſe to their own heap, and do only ſtudy themſelves and their own houſes; they corrupt and deſtroy that common ſociety which ought to be in the members of the body.</p>
                  <p>I read that Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixth, a monkiſh man, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded once of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Sariſbury</hi> his country-man what opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion the world had of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He anſwered that.</p>
                  <p>The Church of Rome which ſhould be a mother, was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſtepmother, and gathered and got all from her own children.</p>
                  <p>The Pope replyed with a tale.</p>
                  <p>All the parts of the body did conſpire againſt the ſtomack, and thought much to labour for that, whereupon they reſolved to feed it no longer: but within few dayes, there grew ſuch a generall decay in the ſtate of all the parts of the body, that at laſt finding their errour, they laboured as before for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104898:30"/>the ſtomack, and found then that that maintained them all.</p>
                  <p>The Popes application was, that the Pope is the ſtomack in the body of the Church; and that though all the members of the body do feed him, yet he gathereth not for himſelf but for the whole body.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that the father of a Common-wealth is the ſtomack, from whence all the body as from the root deriveth ſap, and nutriment, and therefore all muſt labour for him:</p>
                  <p>But one body muſt have but one ſtomack; and therefore when every man ſhall rob and ſpoile and ſwallow up what he can, the body muſt needs periſh.</p>
                  <p>Again, where that one ſtomack is good, the body thrives, for that hath not only an appetitive faculty to deſire food, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive to entertain it, and a retentive to keep it, but a digeſtive alſo to diſtribute it into all the parts of the body.</p>
                  <p>But if the ſtomack be appetitive, and rapine, and devour all, as in ſome diſeaſe, <hi>Caninus appetitus,</hi> which is a greedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer; or if it be retentive and will part with nothing, but is the hell and grave of all that it receiveth, as in covetouſneſſe; or if it be defective in the retentive faculty, and caſt up all, as in prodigality and waſte:</p>
                  <p>Or if it be ill affected in the digeſtive faculty, that it feedeth nothing but ill humours, to overthrow the contemperament of the complexions; That is</p>
                  <p>If it feed the ſanguine only, and ſo maintain all kind of wantonneſſe, pride and vanity.</p>
                  <p>If it feed only choler, and ſo ſupport tyranny and violence.</p>
                  <p>Or if it ſupport only Melancholy, it feedeth ſullen and buſie projecting wit.</p>
                  <p>Or if it feed fleame, it ſuſtaineth idleneſſe; if it do not nouriſh the temperament of theſe humours in the body, it feedeth diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and deſtroyeth the body.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the Common-wealth of the Jewes at this time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, and only the choler was fed, which brought forth grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, ſpoyling, violence, ſtrife: So riches became the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of evil doing, and power was the mother and nurſe of violence.</p>

                  <p>We ſee the danger of this Common-wealth of the Jewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their oppreſſion, and we ſee the remedy-here uſed to complain thereof to God; therefore if we with <hi>Solomon, Turne and conſider all the oppreſſions that are wrought under the Sun,</hi>

                  <p>Therefore, where the Law is ſlacked, and Religion ſet at nought, the deſpiſers thereof have no lawfull intereſt in any thing that they poſſeſſe: but are intruders and uſurpers and ſuch as encroach upon Gods rights without any plea of right; they

                  <p>By riches they might have their hearts deſire in any thing here below, they might buy it out.</p>
                  <p>Every one obſerveth the way of his time; if he ſee that there bee no way of riſing or thriving in the world, but by ſuch a mediation, the whole addreſſe is that way, and that means is wholly ſtudied.</p>
                  <p>If a man ſee that there is nothing to be had without mony, for mony any thing, then mony is his whole ſtudy: <hi>quaerenda pecunia primum.</hi>

                  <p>And ſure if men did ſee that nothing but vertue and Religion and the fear of God did preferre men, and ſufficient worth for the place that they ſeek, men would ſtudy vertue and honeſty, and all thoſe parts which might make them worthy of what they ſeek.</p>
                  <p>But it is no matter, let the men of this world ſhare amongſt them things temporall, and let them break and ſlack the Law of God to humour the preſent times, as thoſe Jewes at this time did of who the Prophet doth complain; <hi>I will give them ſauce to their meat:</hi> For three things well conſidered will call us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from theſe temporall deſires, and make us deſpiſe the world.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though one man had all that this world affordeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, yet all this could not ſatisfie his unbounded deſire, he could not take uſe of it all, he ſhould have but the beholding of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104898:32"/>ſome of it with his eye, and that the leaſt part of the whole.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All theſe things could not give reſt and peace to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or heal the diſeaſed ſoul, or comfort at the dying hour: they cannot ſtand in the gap to turn away the judgement of God, they cannot ſo much as cure the head-ach, or the tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, or any diſeaſe of the body.</p>
                  <p>When our ſins be ripe and ready for the gathering, all the wealth of the world cannot keep out the ſickle of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. None of all this ſublunary happineſſe can extend it ſelfe to eternity; we brought it not with us, and we muſt leave it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us, and as <hi>Zophar</hi> ſaid,</p>

                     <hi>God ſhall caſt them out of his belly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither do all men tarry till they die to lay down theſe things; we have heard with our ears, and ſeen in our owne times, how ſome have outlived great honours, and ſeen them conferred upon others: we have ſeen great eſteemed rich men break, and their Poverty come upon them like an armed man.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, the man that keepeth the Law of God with his whole heart, and doth his beſt to walk conſcionably before God and man, that man hath three benefits, which would encourage any man to embrace the law of God with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and they are the three things in this life, moſt of all to be deſired

                  <p>But I have none ſuch in this audience to admoniſh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I omit that exhortation as unproper for this hearing.</p>
                  <p>For us, if we hear the cry and complaint of our brethren,<label type="milestone">

                  <p>Inſurrection againſt the Magiſtrate, and depoſition of Kings, and violence offered to their Perſons even unto death, is a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian doctrine. <hi>Buchanan</hi> the Scottiſh Chronicler our Kings firſt Schoolmaſter in his book <hi>de jure regni,</hi> was the firſt broacher hereof; who maketh Kings to derive their authority from the People, and giveth power to the People to take away the ſame if he govern not juſtly.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this we have Gods own word, ſaying, <hi>Touch not mine annointed,</hi> where he calleth Kings his annointed by a ſpecial title, not given to any other Perſons, but ſuch as exerciſe regal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity all the Scripture through; And if they may not be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, much leſſe may they be depoſed or their Perſons violated.</p>
                  <p>And this title is not only given to <hi>David</hi> but to <hi>Cyrus. Thus

                  <p>The Apoſtle is a better guide, he bids pray for them, and if you conſider what Kings then raigned, you will ſay there could not be worſe.</p>
                  <p>I muſt therefore with the Apoſtle admoniſh, let every ſoul ſubmit it ſelfe; Let no man, let not a confederacie of men ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly and maliciouſly advance themſelves againſt the Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed: hand off, offer him violence: uſe not the tongue to curſe him: uſe not the pen againſt him to libel him: Curſe him not in thy heart, touch him no noxious and offenſive way: and if ſubordinate Magiſtrates do let wrong judgement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, appeal from them to him that ſitteth on the Throne of Iuſtice, who doth drive away all evil with his eye.</p>
                  <p>If he will not do thee right, go in the Prophet <hi>Habakkuks</hi> way, wraſtle with God by thy prayers, and make thy complaint to him. <hi>He heareth the complaint of the poore.</hi>

                  <p>Surely there be infirmities in the Saints of God, and this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation with God is an effect of infirmity: Yet ſhall you ſee that this doth no way weaken the doctrine before delivered, that it is lawfull to expoſtulate with God in our prayers.</p>
                  <p>The infirmities of Gods ſervants are of two ſorts:
<list>
                        <item>1. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall:</item>
                        <item>2. Sinfull.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt ſo deſtinguiſh, for when Chriſt took our nature into the unity of his perſon; with it he took upon him all our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, but not our ſinfull ones. For he was like man in all things but ſin.</p>
                  <p>Three eſpecially are noted in the ſtory of the Goſpel; that is to ſay,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sorrow: Fear: Anger:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Sorrow,</hi> for he wept and mourned.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Fear,</hi> for he was heard in that he feared.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Anger,</hi> for he did often chide, and reprove,</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Theſe affections be naturall, and ſo long as they be affections, they are without blame when they exubrate, and grow into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, then they are faulty. For there is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which is the inclination: and there is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which is the inflammation of nature.</p>
                  <p>God who in creation gave theſe affections to nature, hath not denyed us the uſe of them; yea he hath ordained them as excellent helps for his work of grace in us.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we find fear mingled with faith to keep it from ſwelling into preſumption, that fear is not a ſin in the Elect, as ſome weak conſciences ignorantly miſtake it; but it is <hi>Cos fidei,</hi> the whetſtone of faith to give it the more edge.</p>
                  <p>As in that complaint of <hi>David, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> Where the firſt part of that complaint is <hi>vox fidei,</hi> the voice of faith, <hi>My God my God:</hi> the ſecond is <hi>vox ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moris,</hi> the voice of fear, <hi>quare me direliquiſti:</hi> and we ſay, fear is a good keeper, it makes us lay ſo much the faſter hold on God by faith; Yea it is a warning to us to avoyd any thing that may do us hurt.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes we find fear mingled with joy; as for example;</p>

                  <p>They were overcome with joy for their deliverance and reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet they felt withall a fear, that it was too good to be true, and doubted that it was but a dream.</p>
                  <p>We do not receive any good newes but before the hearing of it we fear;<note place="margin">Luk. 1.13.</note> the Angel that appeared to <hi>Zecharie</hi> the Preiſt found him afraid.</p>
                  <p>The Angel that came to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> found her afraid; ſo did he that brought the newes of the birth of Chriſt to the ſhepheards: for all men know that we have no cauſe to expect any newes from heaven, wee are ſo evill and ſinfull.</p>
                  <p>And although the comforts of God do remove that fear for a time, yet God would not have it quite extinguiſhed in us: for the Prophet biddeth us, <hi>Serve the Lord with fear,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.11.</note> 
                     <hi>and rejoyce with trembling.</hi> And the Apoſtle doth bid us too, <hi>workout our ſalvation with fear and tembling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes greif is mingled with faith, as in the poor man in the Goſpel of whom Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Doeſt thou beleeve?</hi> he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red firſt with his tears, then with his words ſaying; <hi>Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, help thou my unbeleefe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So in the Publicane beating his breaſt, and ſaying; <hi>Lord, be mercifull to me a ſinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes indignation is mingled with faith, as in all the imprecations of the Prophet, which as they are Prophecies and ſo proceed from the Spirit of God: ſo are they paſſions in theſe holy men, and are vented with that indignation, of which the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Be angry and ſin not:</hi> and which the ſame Prophet juſtifieth, <hi>Shall not I hate them O Lord which hate thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this holy indignation you ſee in the very ſeparate ſoules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They cry with a loud voice, how long Lord doſt thou not judg and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</hi>

                  <p>The example of our Saviour Chriſt is full, and giveth teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to this truth: for coming of purpoſe to lay down his life for his Church, and knowing it to be his Fathers will that he ſhould ſo do; yet in the garden he three times prayed, <hi>that if it were poſſible that cup might paſſe from him;</hi> he did not reſiſt the Will of God, for to that he ſubmitted himſelf; but he diſtiked that which he was to ſuffer according to that Will.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe it was evil and a puniſhment, and he who taught us to pray, <hi>libera nos a malo, Deliver us from evil,</hi> did ſo himſelf.</p>
                  <p>So though he knew the Will of God to be peremptorie for the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the rejection of the Jewes, he ſorrowed and wept for the ſame: which ſhewed his diſlike of the thing decreed, though he approved the decree it ſelf and reſiſted it not.</p>
                  <p>Sorrow is a griefe taken by a naturall diſlike of that for which we greive.</p>
                  <p>When our parents, wives, children, or freinds die, we greive; the Apoſtle doth not forbid that affection, he limiteth and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth it; he would not have us ſorrow as men without hope.</p>
                  <p>And when he took on him our naturall infirmities and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he did not ſo undertake them to remove them from us, or to extinguiſh them in us, but to correct and temper them.

                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:104898:37"/>I conclude this point as before with <hi>Davids</hi> words, I deny not that this was the Prophets infirmitie; I deny it to be his iniquity, it was no ſin in him. And I again urge my former point of Doctrine, it is lawfull for the holy ſervants of God to expoſtulate and conteſt with God in their prayers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe hereby we declare our diſlike of thoſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which we conteſt,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> as here the Prophet ſheweth that it is to him very hateful and offenſive to behold the ſins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which both corrupt and end anger the ſtate of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
                  <p>So when the Prophet complaineth often of Gods long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring toward the wicked, he ſheweth it to be an offence to the children of God, that the enemies of God ſhould be ſo long forborne.</p>
                  <p>And when he awaketh God, <hi>up Lord why ſleepeſt thou,</hi> and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to revenge of his own cauſe, therein he declareth his zeal of the glory of God, of which he muſt be careful eſpecially.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This publique expoſtulation uſed in this caſe to awake the juſtice of God againſt the wicked,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> doth ſeem to terrifie the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly from their wicked wayes; for when they ſee that they that fear God, and walk before him, and with him, are up in armes againſt them, and bandie their imprecations againſt them, they cannot but ſee their eſtates in great danger.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This expoſtulation of the juſt doth declare that their yeilding to the Will of God in theſe things which they do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence to Gods diſlike,<note place="margin">3 <hi>Reaſ.</hi>
                     </note> is not out of naturall principles and reaſons incident to humanity, but from a ſupernaturall dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and yeelding of themſelves to the tranſcendent Will of God whereby they do approve even what they do diſlike, becauſe they find the Will of God that way.</p>
                  <p>The profit which we may make of this point is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To teach us zeal in the cauſe of God; for there is no life in the ſervice that we performe to God without zeal; there is not only the Spirit of God required in us, but fervency of the Spirit by the Apoſtle; and that the ſame Apoſtle calleth the Spirit <hi>dwelling in us plentifully,</hi> and in another place: <hi>The Spirit ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying us throughout.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This giving our bow the full bent, that it may have the full
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104898:38"/>ſtrength, and this to be drawn home, when we ſend our prayers up to heaven that they may reach the mark, this is <hi>So run that ye may obtaine:</hi> It is called ſtriving to the mark;</p>
                  <p>Zeal only uſed in matters of forme and ceremonie, and in outward things, makes us like <hi>Agrippa</hi> almoſt Chriſtians; but zeal againſt the evil life and crying ſins of the time is diſcreet and neceſſary; for theſe do hack and hew the bough we ſtand upon, theſe under-dig the ground we walk upon.</p>
                  <p>Theſe put it to an if: <hi>Si filius dei es,</hi> if thou be the Son of God. Let them that love righteouſneſſe and peace be troubled at theſe things, and quench this common fire firſt, that is the Apoſtles method.</p>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. Of want of zeal where it moſt ſhould be.</item>
                     <item>2. Of inordinate zeal in other things.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The want of zeal in many Profeſſours of Religion, is ſuch as that both Poperie, and Anabaptiſtrie, and other ſchiſmaticall and ſectarious profeſſors are ſuffered to grow up together with the profeſſion of the Goſpel, which could not be if we had zeal proportionable to our knowledge: ſuch as was in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, All falſe wayes Iutterly abhorre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſee alſo great corruptions in manners which holy zeal might ſoon eat out, and without which Religion may bring us to Church, and to the Font, and to the Lords Table, and may rank us with outward profeſſors: but till we grow to ſuch an hatred of ſin, as the very patience and forbearance of God toward thoſe that do abominably, and will not be reformed, doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and greive us, and make us complain, we fail and come ſhort of duty to God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another complaint of the Church, is of inordinate zeal. Which is,</p>
                  <list>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:104898:38"/>

                     <item>2. Or in reſpect of the things; when men carryed with the ſtrong current of opinion, find fault where no fault is, or make the fault greater then it is.</item>
                     <item>3. Or in reſpect of times, when men prevent the time, and exaſperate the judgments of God, and provoke his juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their brethren, before they have done all that can be done by the ſpirit of meekneſſe.</item>
                     <item>4. Or in reſpect of time when they expreſſe their zeale. Firſt, againſt thoſe things that may with leaſt hurt to the Church be forborn, till more concerning affairs of the Church be adviſedly thought upon.</item>
                     <item>5. Or in reſpect of the meaſure of zeal, if it be more or leſſe then the cauſe of God requireth.</item>
                     <item>6. In reſpect of the mixture of it, if it be commeded with any of our own corrupt and furious perturbations.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="2">2. Seeing therefore we may make ſo boldwith God as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet here doth; we are to be taught that God is ſo ſlow in the execution of his judgments, even upon them that do ill, that till he find that his patience is a burthen to his Church, and till he be even chidden to it by his faithful ones, he cannot ſtrike.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we muſt both ſtirre up our ſelves and our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to a ſerious conſideration of this goodneſſe of God, and that which the Apoſtle doth call <hi>The riches of his patience,</hi> that we deſpiſe it not, that we ſpend not ſuch riches unthriftily, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it upon our repentance, and making our peace with God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seeing we may thus call God to account, as the Prophet here doth, and chide his remiſſeneſſe, let us not take it ill at the hands of God if he chide us for our ſins, which do well deſerve it, and he conteſt with us for our neglect of our duties, either to him or our brethren.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Seeing we have ſo good warrant for it, when we ſee any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remedied evils which do threaten ruine to our Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, which perchance the Miniſter may be forbidden to reprove or to diſſwadeſ, uch as theſe in my text. Violence and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, corruption of Religion, and corruption of Courts of Juſtice, which the Miniſter in general terms may reprove, but he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104898:39"/>muſt not with <hi>Nathan</hi> ſay <hi>tu es homo,</hi> thou art the man, to any delinquent in any of theſe kinds.</p>
                  <p>This then is the remedy, we may go to God himſelfe, and chide with him for it, without any feare of <hi>ſcandalum magnatum,</hi> and in holy indignation and zeal of Gods glory, laying aſide our own corrupt paſſions, we may call him to account for ſhewing us and making us to ſee ſuch things.</p>
                  <p>And I do not doubt but we ſhall have as good ſucceſſe as this Prophet had, as the next ſection of this chapter doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Chaldaea</hi> lay from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> North; it was a mighty Kingdom; and the cheif City thereof was <hi>Babylon; Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was King thereof; they are to be ſtirred up by God himſelf, who, as you heard out of <hi>Obadiah,</hi> doth uſe to puniſh one Nation by another, and ſometimes his Church by the Heathen.</p>
                  <p>He gave <hi>Iſrael</hi> the promiſed land upon condition of their obedience to his Law; and now finding them rebellious, he giveth away their land to the heathen; and as before he drove out the poſterity of <hi>Canaan</hi> to plant <hi>Iſrael</hi> there, now he will remove them, and give their land to the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi>

                  <p>It is blaſphemie to ſay or think that any thing is, or can be done againſt the will, or without the power of God, or that God doth lend his power to any againſt himſelfe, and his Will, for that deſtroyeth the Omnipotent Providence of God.</p>

                  <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> handling this point doth thus exemplifie it.</p>

                  <p>Yet for the action of violence. God ſeeth his people of the Jews for contempt of Religion, and for corruption of Juſtice, and for violence to one another worthy of puniſhment, he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them worthy to be puniſhed with violence, and therefore he ſtirreth up a violent nation againſt them.</p>
                  <p>He ſeeth that they live by oppreſſion, and therefore he ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth oppreſſours to ſtrip them out of all.</p>

                  <p>Conſider all this as <hi>malum panis,</hi> the evil of puniſhment, and ſo God is Author, Suggeſtor, and operator herein.</p>
                  <p>But conſider how the Chaldaeans work in this affaire, and God himſelf acquitteth himſelf in this text, and putteth it off up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Their judgement and their dignity ſhall proceed from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> That which they ſeek is a project of their own,<note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> they know not what God would have done, and as they adviſe not with him, nor underſtand that he ſtirreth them, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge nothing to him, as it followeth, for they thank their own god for the victory.</p>
                  <p>You do now ſee Gods good end, and their evil, and in this one action; and Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deus quaſdam volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſuas utique bonas implet, per malorum hominum voluntates malas. Vide Whitak. contra Camp. ratione</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>From hence it cometh that they, which fulfilling the Will of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104898:49"/>God, which they know not, do fulfil their own Will, which they aime at, have no reward of their ſervice, but rather are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter puniſhed for the ſame, as <hi>Hugo de Sancto victore,</hi> ſaith.</p>

                  <p>It ſufficeth that wee ſee the intention of the Chaldaeans evil, for that condemneth them, and his judgement upon them, which followeth in this chapter, doth prove, that their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion make their whole ſervice corrupt, ſo that though it pleaſed God that evil was done againſt the Jews, they did not pleaſe God that did execute the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The rule is true, that all evil actions are juſtly judged by the intentions of their Agents, good actions are not ſo.</p>

                  <p>But an evil intention is ſufficient to corrupt any action, though it carry never ſo ſpecious a ſhew of good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſonnes went about a good action, to draw the Sheche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites into a conformity with the Hebrews in Religion, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Shechemites, which made them embrace the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was the enriching of themſelves by this correſpondencie, the intention of <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſonnes was to betray them to death, and God puniſhed them both the Shechemites with death, the ſonnes of <hi>Jacob</hi> with their fathers curſe.</p>
                  <p>And the Chaldaeans puniſhed the Jews, and ſought therein the glory of God only, and gave him the praiſe of their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of whom they borrowed the power of their ſtrength they had been blameleſſe; but their hands concurred with the juſt will of God, their hearts did not, yet God is juſt in employing them.</p>
                  <p>The rule therfore is, that he that willeth the ſame thing which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104898:50"/>God willeth, &amp; doth the ſame thing which God would have done ſinneth, except he willeth and doth the ſame thing, in the ſame matter and for the ſame end which God projecteth. <hi>Let the ſame mind be in you that was in Chriſt Jeſus, arme your ſelves with the ſame mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That mind is an armour againſt the wrath of God;<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>We do nothing, but as God doth guide the hand, ſo he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the heart and affections to it, if he do not alſo enlighten our underſtandings, and apply our minds to it, we are carried as bruit beaſts, we are not led as men.</p>

                  <p>Here God foreſaw a ſinne in the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> which was never committed, but <hi>Saul</hi> had ſent, and God knew the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart of thoſe men, and gave warning.</p>

                  <p>But in reſpect of the ſucceſſe it was conditional, becauſe it hath reference to the means of evaſion.</p>
                  <p>So God foreſaw the death of <hi>Ezechiah</hi> by his conditional

                  <p>Thus God foreſeeth the ſpawning of ſinne in mans life, in the ſeed or root thereof, which is luſt, yet he reveileth means to keep the juſt from falling into theſe ſins.</p>
                  <p>But for the wicked, he leaveth them to the ſtream and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of their own free-will, and leadeth them into temptation. For temptation is their puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>This may ſtirre us up to husband the means of grace, to the beſt advantage of our ſouls to keep us undefiled in the way, that iniquity may not have dominion over us.</p>

                  <p>This god muſt have the glory of the Chaldaeans Conqueſt; and what greater diſhonour can they do to the living God, then to give his glory to liveleſſe and ſenſeleſſe ſtocks?</p>

                  <p>For ſeeing God is an inviſible eſſence, and they are loth to worſhip what they cannot ſee, and they walk by ſenſe and not by faith, the inviſible Deity is by them worſhipped in ſome viſible forme, and I cannot judge more hardly againſt them then that</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſumme</hi> hereof is this: whereas the Prophet at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the ſins of the Jews, was moved with an holy indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt them, and with zeal of Gods glory which turned him into a chiding expoſtulation with God, for bearing ſo much with them, and therefore did ſtirre up God to judgement to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104898:62"/>chaſten them in the firſt ſection of this chapter.</p>
                  <p>Now that God hath anſwered him in the ſecond, with decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his purpoſe to puniſh the iniquities of the Jews by the Chaldaeans, whom God would ſtirre up to fight againſt them, and to prevail: Now in this third ſection, the Prophet is as much troubled and grieved at their puniſhment, as he was before at their ſin.</p>
                  <p>Now he chides as faſt, and diſputes as hotly againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſeneſſe and patience of God toward the Chaldaean, as he did before toward the Jew.</p>
                  <p>Before he pleaded the cauſe of the glory of Gods Iuſtice, in puniſhing the iniquity of the Iews; now he pleads the glory of Gods mercy in ſparing them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part was imprecation, this deprecation. And herein the Prophet doth declare his mixt affection to the Jews; for out of his hatred to their ſins he deſired their correction; but now out of his love to their Perſons, he prayeth againſt their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo farre that it may be moderate, as in <hi>Ieremies</hi> Prayer.</p>

                  <p>For as God is eternal in himſelf, ſo is he to his Church, and from the eternity of God doth the eternity of Angels and men derive it ſelf, for eternity cannot flow from any thing that is not it ſelfe eternal; and we know that the nature of Angels and men is eternal, both of them being by the eternal God created to abide for ever: the elect Angels and men in eternal glory, the reprobate Angels and men in eternal ſhame and pain.</p>
                  <p>Yet is the judgement of the reprobate in Scripture called by the names of <hi>Death, Deſtruction, Periſhing,</hi> becauſe theſe be titles of the greateſt horrour and diſmay, that the heart of man can conceive.</p>
                  <p>Now we have two hopes built upon this foundation of Gods eternity, <hi>non moriemur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Temporal, that God will ſtill reſerve a remnant of the Jews to return again to the poſſeſſion of their fathers, and to build again the City and the temple, and to renew the face of a

                  <p n="2">2. Eternal, That God will not utterly caſt off his People from his favour, but that although he ſcourge them with the rods of men, even to a temporal loſſe of their land, their liberty, and their lives, yet <hi>non moriemur,</hi> we ſhall not loſe our intereſt in his promiſe of a better life.</p>
                  <p>So that the Prophet doth teach us the right uſe of the doctrine of Gods eternity, to aſſure us againſt all temporal and eternal evils.</p>
                  <p>And this doth <hi>Moſes</hi> conclude for this Antecedent, <hi>Before the mountains were brought forth,</hi>

                  <p>From the power of Gods Eternity, there is a return for the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou renueſt the face of the earth. Non moriemur,</hi> death our laſt enemy ſhall be deſtroyed and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, we ſhal be tranſlated from death to life; this is clear: becauſe God hath in eternal wiſedom, appointed an eternal redemption for ſome to an eternal inheritance of eternal glory.</p>
                  <p>This eternity of God is two fold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Eternitas eſſentiae,</hi> Eternity of Eſſence in himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Eternitas Providentiae,</hi> Eternity of Providence, in reſpect of his creatures.</p>
                  <p>From the firſt we conclude the ſecond for if God be in his own nature eternal, he hath alſo an eternal Providence, by which he governeth all things: his word by which he governeth is alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal in the heavens.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> proveth this point of Gods eternity thus,<note place="margin">Quaeſt. 83 l. c. 19.</note>

                  <p>Such is our God without variableneſſe or ſhadow of change, and therefore eternal.</p>
                  <p>And whereas from this eternity our Prophet doth conclude <hi>Non moriemur,</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth therefore call our eternity <hi>immortalitatem,</hi> rather then <hi>aeternitatem.</hi>

                  <p>Neither is it neceſſary for adoration, that we do aſſigne any ſet figure to God in our thoughts, ſeeing every one of us doth believe that he hath a living ſoule in him, whereby all the parts
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104898:69"/>of the body are both directed and enabled in their ſeveral offices, yet no man can conceive any ſet forme or ſimilitude wherunto it may be reſembled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another figurative ſpeech here is, where the Prophet calleth theſe eyes of God <hi>pure eyes;</hi> for wickednes and evil cannot defile the <hi>ſight:</hi> it is ſaid of the fair eye of heaven, that it ſhineth upon the juſt and unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>David</hi> ſaith; <hi>that God ſeeth all the thoughts of mans heart,</hi> why he then ſeeth much vanity and much iniquity.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe are called pure eyes which do behold nothing that is evil, to approve it in it ſelfe, to abet it in our brother, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it in our ſelves, and in this ſenſe the eyes of God are ſaid to be pure, that is, abhorring ſin.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Purity of Gods eyes doth import the clear judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, which is of ſuch penetration as nothing can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it ſelf from him, in which ſenſe <hi>David</hi> ſaith,</p>

                  <p>The ſin of the Angels that kept not their firſt eſtate, was ſoon found out and puniſhed; the firſt news we hear of them was that one of them was a tempter, and deceived our firſt Parents.</p>
                  <p>There was a light ſhining in darkneſſe, which the darkneſſe comprehended not. The Manichees ſeeing the devil went ſo early againſt God, thought and taught that there were two <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipia,</hi> two beginnings, one good God the Author of all good, another evil God the Author of all evil, not knowing the fall of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104898:70"/>the Angels, and the miſchief that they attempted againſt God after their fall.</p>
                  <p>But they were the firſt example of the ſevere vengeance of God. Of whom Saint <hi>Iude</hi> ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Angels which kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jude 6.</note> 
                     <hi>he hath reſerved in everlaſting chains under dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, unto the judgement of the laſt day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for our firſt Parents, the pure eyes of God ſaw their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe after their fall, and came himſelf into the garden in the coole of the day and convinced the Delinquents, and examined the fault, and gave judgment againſt them all, and preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted that judgment.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cain</hi> when his ſin was yet but in the bud, at the firſt put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth thereof, in the caſting down of his countenance, was called to account for it, God diſputing the matter with him, and after when he came to the execution of his abominable wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, God again well examined the evidence, convicted the Priſoner, and brought him to confeſſion of his fault, and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from his preſence.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe examples God was a ſpeedy and a ſevere Judge, as was fit for terrour in the beginning; but after he grew more remiſſe, and as the Apoſtle ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The long-ſuffering of God waited in the days of</hi> Noah, <hi>while the Ark was a preparing;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.20</note> So that God declared himſelf patient and long-ſuffering, who had before ſhewed and revealed his ſevere Juſtice, that the terrour of his righteouſneſſe might diſcourage ſin, and yet his gentle forbearance might invite to repentance.</p>
                  <p>Therefore throughout the whole courſe of holy Scripture, we have examples of both ſorts, both of quick vengeance and of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſufferance, that God may be known both to be juſt and merciful. The reaſon whereof is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the danger might breed terrour; for who can promiſe himſelf mercy, when our juſt God may and doth take ſuch quick vengeance? Remember <hi>Lots</hi> wife, that ſhe was <hi>Lots</hi> wife whom God favoured, that the Angel pulled her out of <hi>Sodom</hi> to haſten her from their judgment, that her offence was no more then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, whether out of curioſity to ſee what God would do to <hi>Sodome,</hi> or out of unbelief doubting the truth of the threatning,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104898:70"/>or out of love to the place, or to ſome perſons left behind to the wo, ſhe was made an example of preſent calamity and turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a pillar of ſalt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore remember <hi>Lots</hi> wife for terrour, to ſtrike fear in thee that thou ſin not, leaſt thou be ſmitten ſo ſoon as thou haſt offended; this to prevent ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That ſuch as ſin and find not the preſent wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging ſin, may make uſe of that patience of God to repent, leaſt a lingring judgment be but the whetting of a ſword to a ſharper cutting when it cometh.</p>
                  <p>For the remiſſeneſſe of God doth not proceed from any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Perſons, nor from a liking of any kind of ſin, but out of free and undeſerved favour, and for the glory of his own mercy, that he may be feared.</p>
                  <p>Who knoweth the mind of the Lord,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>

                  </p>
                  <p>Therfore our care muſt be to keep our heart with all diligence from conceiving ſin, to take heed to our ways that we offend not in our tongue, to take heed to our foot, to our hand that they act not ſin, ever remembring that God is a jealous God, and that loveth not iniquity, and that he hath pure eyes which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not behold evil to allow thereof.</p>

                  <p>Let us reſolve on that, and we may ſafely ſit down and wonder at the effects of his will; for <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tu facis mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia ſolus,</hi> Thou alone doſt wonders. And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that God doth manage things <hi>Judicio ſaepe arcano ſed ſemper juſto,</hi> often by ſecret, but always by juſt judgment.</p>
                  <p>And upon this holy reſolution of the Prophet, which giveth God his due and no way doth tax him, but pronounceth him to be himſelf,</p>
                  <p>I dare not receive the judgment of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> upon this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, becauſe I am perſwaded that he is too harſh in his cenſure of this Prophet, and yet I find it ſo much againſt his will to find fault, that he doth what he can again, when he hath wounded him to heal him again.</p>
                  <p>I honour the memory of Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> as of a clear light ſet up in the Church of God, and am as unwilling to tax him, as I find him unwilling to tax the Prophet, and therefore I wiſh his Reader to read him out upon this place, and he ſhall find that it is not <hi>motus violentus,</hi> but <hi>trepidationis,</hi> not a violent, but a trembling motion that carries him.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104898:72"/>ſomwhat wavering; that cannot be defended; for the <hi>motto</hi> of a juſt man is <hi>ſemper idem,</hi> always the ſame; and it is the ungodly man who is unſtable in all his ways; his heart is not eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But he ſmiteth home when he ſaith, <hi>verum quidem eſt, ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam partem verſus affinem eſſe blaſphemiae,</hi> the ſecond part of the verſe to be near a kinne to blaſphemy; <hi>quia obmurmurat &amp; inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulat deum unimiae tarditatis,</hi> becauſe he murmured and accuſed God of too much ſlackneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Yet Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> healeth him again; pardon him in this; for he was in <hi>Angusto</hi> in a ſtrait, jealous of having the honour of God touched by the Prophet, and yet tender of any touch of the charity that he did owe to the Prophet, and therefore having delared his holy love to God, he doth his beſt to excuſe the Prophet, ſaying of him, <hi>fraenum ſibi injicit &amp; occurrit mature. Se temperat ut praeveniat nimium fervorem,</hi> he tempers himſelf that he might allay this too great heat.</p>
                  <p>And in the end he confeſſeth, <hi>quia non poteſt ſe expedire rebus tam confuſis, diſceptat potius ſecum quàm cum deo,</hi> becauſe he could not get out of this maze, that he reaſoned with himſelf rather then God.</p>
                  <p>For my opinion I acquit the Prophet from any ſuſpicion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate affection in this his complaint, ſo long as he doth do God the right to acknowledge him both eternall and equal; I wonder not if he, and all that conſider him aright in his ways, be ſwallowed up in the depth of admiration of them.</p>
                  <p>Let any man obſerve that which followeth in the Prophets complaint, and he ſhall ſee great cauſe of wonder; but whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſuch occaſion is offered to us to behold the like, let us do our God the right to confeſſe him holy and juſt, and to reſolve that which way ſoever things go, there can be no fault in him: therefore let us ſay with <hi>David,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet is it not unlawful for the children of God reverently to conſider the ways of God; yea it is a work for the Sabbath, to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104898:72"/>take the works of God into regard.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It argueth a great defect in judgement, when we ſhall think a thought which may derogate any thing from the glory of our God; for it is true, <hi>fecit quicquid voluit,</hi> he hath done whatever he would; ſo it is true <hi>omnia bene fecit,</hi> he hath done all things well, and we ſay truly of him, <hi>He hath done all things for the beſt;</hi> for ſo he doth even then when his ways do croſſe ours, and when thoſe things that he doth do ſeem to us and to our reaſon as moſt oppoſite.</p>
                  <p>To help which our weakneſſe we are taught to pray, <hi>fiat vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas tua,</hi> thy will be done.</p>
                  <p>Let us come then to a view of the particulars which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet recounteth, which God doth behold and not yet puniſh.</p>
                  <p>And herein we ſhall find the Prophet an Orator ſetting forth the iniquity of the times, and the miſeries of the Church then, ſo as we may ſay his heart hath indited a good matter, and his tongue is the Pen of a ready Writer.</p>
                  <p>Here be the Prophets grievances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is treaſon, <hi>Wherefore lookeſt thou upon them that deal treacherouſly?</hi> Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> renders it, <hi>quare aſpicis tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſores?</hi> and ſo doth the Geneva tranſlation render it: <hi>Why lookeſt thou upon the tranſgreſſors?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that is ſomewhat too large, for that includeth all ſorts of ſinners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jun. Cur intuereris perfidos?</hi> ſo the Chaldaeans, of whom the Prophet complaineth, here are ſet forth as you heard by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dolus an virtus, quis in hoste requirat?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 12.2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Treaſon is not wrought by a profeſt enemy in times of open warre, and proclaimed defiance, neither do we call the ſecret practices of enemies working underhand by the name of treaſon, they are military ſtratagems; but it is called treaſon, when by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting ſome of the oppoſite ſide, the enemie doth take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p>And this is commonly one of the mines which is carried under the ſtates of great Kingdomes, to deſtroy them and blow them up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:104898:73"/>And the Author and Finiſher of our ſalvation, though he was aſſaulted by profeſt warre of the chief Prieſts, Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, yet he was put into their hand at laſt by treaſon; one of his own twelve betrayed him.</p>
                  <p>And it is the chief uſe of the new order of Jeſuits in forrein States to corrupt the affections of ſubjects, <hi>ut prodant,</hi> that they may betray.</p>
                  <p>This is a great grievance; for treaſons be commonly carried with great ſecreſie; yet the Prophet ſaith, that God looketh on, he beholden all the conveyances both of Projection and Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that is it which amazeth the Prophet, that God who loveth not treaſon, ſhould look on and behold it in all the ingreſſe and progreſſe of it, and not ſtop it.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, we have a leſſon from hence.</p>
                  <p>The Lord ſeeth treaſon.<label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>Not only the great treaſons wrought againſt States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, but the particular falſhoods in common friendſhip: the private inſidiations for the goods, the chaſtity, the good name, the life of our neighbours.</p>
                  <p>It is not any negligence in Gods government of the world or any over-ſight, or any forgetfulneſſe, or any approbation of evil, that doth keep God ſo quiet, that he ſitteth in heaven, he keepeth <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and he neither ſlumbreth nor ſleepeth.</p>
                  <p>Yet he looketh on, while thieves come in the night, and break open a way into mens houſes, gather together and rifle, and carry away their goods.</p>
                  <p>He ſeeth whilſt the ſecret enemy watcheth his brother upon the way, or goeth forth with him as <hi>Abel</hi> did with <hi>Cain:</hi> God knew that <hi>Abel</hi> was to be killed that day.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Amaſa</hi> met, God ſaw it a death, he knew that embracing would prove a ſtab.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes God doth detect and defeat theſe treaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ſometimes he letteth them go on to the very moment of execution, yet then he diſappointeth them: but ſometimes he looketh on, and ſeeth them performed and hindreth them not.</p>
                  <p>This is that which the Prophet would fain know why God that loveth no evil, and hath power at hand to prevent it, doth look on and ſee it done; for amongſt us, <hi>quinon vetat peccare cum
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104898:73"/>licet jubet:</hi> he that when he may, hindreth not a fault, commands it; and for man it is a true rule, that all the evil which we might have hindred and did not, ſhall be put upon our account.</p>
                  <p>This rule holds indeed with us, but God is not ſo limited; he maketh both evil creatures, that is devils and wicked men, to be his ſervants to do his will, and he maketh the very ſins of men rods to ſcourge both themſelves that commit them and others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond grievance of the Prophet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous then he, and God holdeth his tongue.</hi> That is, the Chaldaean who worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth ſtrange gods, devoureth the Iews the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who though they be much too blame, yet they are more righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then Chaldaeans, and God ſeeth and ſaith nothing whilſt the Chaldaeans doth ſpoil <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This indeed is a great grievance to behold the afflictions of the Church, and the power of the wicked againſt them; it was that which put <hi>David</hi> into an extreme extaſie for the time, and till he went to the houſe of God, and was there taught the end of ſuch men as hurt their betters, his foot had well nigh ſlipt.</p>
                  <p>Our experience ſhoweth us much more for the wicked ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> the moths of our Common-wealth, the ruſt of our peace, how have they fed upon the far of the land, and by fair pretexts of common good, even devoured the Common-wealth, and made more righteous men then they their prey, aſſaulting their goods, their liberty, and peace of life, diſturbing their honeſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with inhoneſt encroachments, to the great prejudice of the State?</p>
                  <p>And God held his tongue, many years although he ſaw it; but now he hath ſet open the eyes of the politick body to detect them, and he hath opened the mouth of that body to accuſe and to condemn them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> ſaith, It is a Proverb of the Ancients,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24.13.</note> 
                     <hi>Wickedneſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is wickedneſſe in a grown degree; for the godly be the holy ones of God, and God ſaith, <hi>nolite tangere,</hi> touch not, they do not only <hi>tangere,</hi> but <hi>angere,</hi> yea <hi>devorare juſtiores ſe,</hi> devour juſter then they.</p>
                  <p>There is a natural antipathy between the ſeed of the woman
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104898:74"/>and the ſeed of the ſerpent; ſinners cannot abide them that carry any face or ſhew of Religion, or the worſhip of God; hating and touching and biting will not ſerve nor ſatisfie they muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The tender mercies of the wicked are cruell, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcera crudelia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 12.10.</note> cruel bowels:</p>
                  <p>The wicked is ever the devourer; obſerve it as a fure rule; that Church or that Common-wealth which devoureth and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſlaughter and effuſion of blood, is the Synagogue of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>The true Church is no ſmiter, no traytor, no plotter, no abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of invaſions; it was ever true <hi>Arma Eccleſiae preces &amp; lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi> the weapons of the Church are prayers and tears.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the mother of murthers, and neſt wherein treaſons breed, the nurſe of Ieſuites, the incendiaries of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> the mint of facinerous Machinations, the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral and dogmatical defenders of the lawfulneſſe of any thing that is done for their own good, hath diſcovered her ſelf to be Antichriſtian by this infallible mark of cruelty; She is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer.</p>
                  <p>It is the Religion of <hi>Rome</hi> that armed the Spaniards againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her land in 88. the bleſſing of the Pope, and the curſe of God was upon that enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For they came to devoure them that were then more righteous then they.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the Religion of <hi>Rome</hi> that digged the vault, that hired, that fraighted the Cellar under the Parliament houſe to blow up all; <hi>os ſepulchri,</hi> the mouth of the grave, <hi>os inferni,</hi> the mouth of hell; the mouth of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall gape and ſwallow with the beſt of them.</p>
                  <p>Surely this is a great grievance and vexation of ſpirit here on earth, to ſee the worſt ſort of men prevailing, and better then they ſwallowed up.</p>

                  <p>Therefore let not our hearts fret at thoſe rods which have no ſtrength to uſe themſelves, but rather ſtoop to the right hand of God, who manageth them for our caſtigation.</p>

                  <p>The grievance is, that the Prophet doth not ſee any end of their cruel perfecutions as yet; for the lingring afflictions which gather increaſe of ſtrength by time, do threaten final ruine, whereas vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent extremities ſpend themſelves into vanity and nothing.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt,</p>
                  <p>The Prophet having diſputed with God, and as his name importeth, having wraſtled with him, doth reſolve,</p>
                  <p>I <hi>will ſtand upon the watch, and ſet me upon the tower,</hi> alluding to the military practice of ſouldiers, who appoint ſome in ſome eminent place to obſerve the enemie, and to give timely warning of their doings.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing God hath declared himſelf an enemy to the Iews, by all thoſe evils which he hath threatned to bring upon them, the Prophet watcheth him, and attendeth to receive further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement from himſelf, concerning his purpoſe toward them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will watch to ſee what he will ſay unto me;</hi> for the ſecrets of the Lord are revealed unto them that fear him: <hi>And God ſpake
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104898:82"/>in the mouth of all the Prophets, which have been ſince the world began.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither doth the Prophet attend God out of a curioſity, <hi>ſcire ut ſciat,</hi> to know only, as <hi>Bern.</hi> ſpeaks, but that he may know what to anſwer for God when he is reproved, or as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſaith much better, when he is argued with, and others come to diſpute with him upon thoſe grievances, as he hath done with God; for you muſt underſtand, that in all the former complaints this Prophet hath not argued as a particular man, but as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the cauſe of the Church, and ſuſtaining the Perſons of all his afflicted brethren, for whoſe ſakes, that he may ſatisfie them, and for Gods ſake whoſe Miniſter he is, that he may know how to maintain to them the cauſe of Gods Wiſedome and Iuſtice, he doth now attend Gods anſwer.</p>
                  <p>By this ſtanding upon the watch and upon the tower, in this place is meant the Prophets attending upon a further Revelation of the Will of God concerning theſe grievances, becauſe in thoſe times God did ſpeak to his Prophets by viſions, and dreams, and ſecret inſpirations.</p>
                  <p>And holy men then had acceſſe to him immediatly, whereby they knew the mind of God, and yet did communicate to them his counſels.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſo as he put them to it to await his good leaſure, and to expect his anſwer. So <hi>David</hi> in his own caſe, <hi>I will heare what the Lord God will ſay unto me.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>And if any ſhall in the name of God broach or vent the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of men, you may ſay to him as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did to <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There are no ſuch things as thou ſayſt, but thou feineſt them out of thine own heart.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nehem. 6.8.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But take heed you exceed not this example of <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> for he did not charge <hi>Sanballat</hi> thus, till he perceived that God had not ſent him, but that he pronounced this prophecy.</p>
                  <p>For many hearers are ſo ſeaſoned with prejudice againſt their Teachers, that if any thing ſound not to the juſt tune of their
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104898:83"/>own fancies, they will ſuddenly quarrel it. Yet as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> ſaith, <hi>If the Counſel be of God, it will stand, whoſoever oppoſe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. This reproveth thoſe forward intruders into the Lords har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, who come unſent, and bring not their Sickle with them, they will work without tools, and they will teach before they have learnt.</p>
                  <p>Like the fooliſh Virgins, they would ſpend of the wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins oyle, they do <hi>ſapere ex Commentario,</hi> and take their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons upon truſt, hearkning what God hath ſaid to others, and not tarrying till God ſpeak to them.</p>
                  <p>It is no wonder if theſe Merchants do break who ſet up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſtock: they be but broken Ciſterns, though ſome water run through them they hold none.</p>
                  <p>The faithful Miniſter muſt not only obſerve <hi>quid dicit domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> what the Lord ſaith, but <hi>quid dicit mihi,</hi> what he ſaith to me: he muſt have the warrant of his own miſſion from a ſpecial illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his own underſtanding, or elſe his Trumpet will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give a certain ſound.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This bindeth the hearer to affection.</p>
                  <p>For if the ſpirit ſpeaketh to the Churches, then <hi>qui habet aures audiendi audiat;</hi> he that hath ears let him hear: <hi>Eſt Deus in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> God is in us; they do not flatter us as they did <hi>Herod,</hi> and we ſhall never die of the wormes for receiving that teſtimony of our Miniſtry, if we deal faithfully, that ſay of our preaching; <hi>The voice of God and not of man;</hi> for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth of the Theſſalonians;</p>

                  <p>But becauſe this requeſt of the Prophets doth concerne others that he may inform them, God addeth, <hi>Make it plain upon Tables that he may run that readeth it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, write my anſwer in a Table in great Characters, that though a man be in haſte and run by, yet he may read as he run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, ſhewing that he was deſirous to ſatisfie all ſuch as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpake of before, who ſhould argue againſt him.</p>

                  <p>But after the flood when the Church in the poſterity of <hi>Iacob</hi> encreaſed, and no doubt had many corruptions by dwelling in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> then was <hi>Moſes</hi> appointed both to be the deliverer of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and to be the Penman of God, to write thoſe things which God would have to remain in the Church for all ſucceeding times, and after him ſucceſſively holy men wrote as they were inſpired.</p>
                  <p>And a better Argument we cannot give for the danger of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written traditions, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth ſo much commend even above Scripture, then this.</p>
                  <p>God ſaw that men had corrupted their ways, and he found the imaginations of mens hearts only evil continually, and that the Church was a very few: therefore he ſtirred up <hi>Noah</hi> to be a Preacher of righteouſneſſe in whom the light of truth was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; he deſtroyed the old ſinful world, and by <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Sem;</hi> he began a new Church to the reſtored world.</p>
                  <p>Yet after <hi>Noahs</hi> death the worſhip of ſtrange gods were brought in; ſo that to heal this grief, and to prevent the danger of traditions, God cauſed the Word to be written by holy men, for the perpetual uſe of his Church, whoſe books were faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerved in all ages thereof.</p>
                  <p>Then came the Sonne of God, and he left his ſpirit in the Church, to lead the Church into all truth, by which ſpirit the New Teſtament was endited and written.</p>
                  <p>So that now all things neceſſary to ſalvation are ſo clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, that traditions of men have no neceſſary uſe in the Church, in the ſubſtance of true Religion: for that which is written is ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> denieth the ſufficiency of Scripture. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their great learned men write both baſely and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly thereof.</p>

                  <p>This wiſdom foreſeeth all things that ſhall be, this wiſdom decreeth all things that he will do, which his power after in the times appointed, doth performe, and bring to act.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Why then do ſo many texts of Scripture tell us that God repenteth.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes he repenteth of the good that he hath done: for to make man upon the earth was a good work, yet it is ſaid</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth,</hi>

                     <hi>and it greived him at his heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So to make <hi>Saul</hi> King over <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a good work, for it was his own choiſe, yet himſelf ſaith, <hi>It repenteth me that I have ſet up</hi> Saul <hi>to be King.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.11.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometime God is ſaid to repent of the evil that he hath done; <hi>malum poenae,</hi> the evil of puniſhment is there to be underſtood. So after the great plague when <hi>David</hi> had made a fault in numbring the people,</p>
                  <p>When the Angel ſtretched out his hand upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, the Lord repented him of the evil,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.16.</note> and ſaid to the Angel, It is enough, ſtay thy hand.</p>
                  <p>And concerning his Word, we have frequent examples in Scripture of events contrary to the letter of his Word. For example,</p>
                  <p>His word was to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by <hi>Iſaiah, ſet thy houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye,</hi> non vives.</p>
                  <p>Yet <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did live 15 years after that; his word was to <hi>Nineveh</hi> by <hi>Jonah,</hi> 40 days and <hi>Niniveh</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed; yet yet it fel not out ſo, and the ſtory ſaith, God repented of the evil that he had ſaid that he would do to them.<note place="margin">Joh. 3.10.</note>

                  <p>For we are ſaid to repent when we change our mindes; now the God of wiſdom and power never changeth his minde, but ſometimes he doth change his operations; there is not <hi>mutatio mentis,</hi> but <hi>mutatio dextrae Excleſi,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Aug.

                  <p>This for want of underſtanding in us to comprehend the ways of God, is called repentance and greif in God: but as <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaith,</p>
                  <q>Non eſt perturbatio, ſed judicium quo irrogatur poena; <hi>as Saint</hi> Paul. I ſpeak after the manner of men, becauſe of the infirmity of your fleſh.</q>

                  <p n="1">1. God doth reveal his ways to the ſons of men, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them what he would have them do, and openeth to them the knowledge, and tendereth to them the uſe of fit means to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which he would have them, and ſo it is ſaid he would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of his Truth.</p>
                  <p>According to this revealed Will of God, he doth offer mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to all, and he doth withall threaten judgment to ſuch as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their own mercy, as <hi>Jonah</hi> ſaith.</p>
                  <p>And when he ſeeth cauſe to call in either his mercy from them that abuſe it, or to ſtop the courſe of his juſtice to them whom correction doth amend, then we ſay he repenteth him of that which he hath either promiſed or threatned: for clearing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of underſtand.</p>
                  <p>That God never changeth in promiſe, or in threatning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in things concerning this life; as in all the examples repeated, all thoſe promiſes and threatnings be uſed as motives to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce obedience, and therefore they are not abſolute but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall.</p>
                  <p>For it is no good argument to perſwade a man to be Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to fear God, abſtaining from all the pleaſing delights of the world, to promiſe him his hearts deſire, if he know that that promiſe doth bind God, that whatſoever he do, he ſhall be partaker of the promiſe.</p>
                  <p>And it is no inducement to diſſwade ſin by the commination of judgment, if the judgment muſt of neceſſity be inflicted.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this revealed Will of God is conditionall, and hath

                  <p>This is the rule of life, and by this Will is the Church of God governed; for by this he doth reveal himſelf, both in his word, and in his permiſſions, and in his operations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God ſignifieth his Will by his Word; for that doth declare in precepts, prohibitions and examples, what God would have to be done, what not to be done; it revealeth both rewards and puniſhments; and it uſeth both promiſes, and threatnings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God ſignifieth his Will by permiſſions, becauſe he declareth thereby, that what he ſuffereth to be done that he willeth to be effected.</p>

                  <p>To this our anſwer is, that this cannot diſcourage Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the decree is paſt and unchangable; this is the proper foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Prayer; for the Apoſtle ſaith;</p>

                  <p>For we not only loſe our labour, but we do alſo offend God, if we ask any thing againſt or beſide his Will: therefore that we might not run into the errour of the ſons of <hi>Zebedee, Neſcitis quid petatis,</hi> you know not what you ſhould ask, Our Saviour hath ſet down a forme of Prayer ſo abſolute, as that we cannot juſtifie the asking of any thing according to the Will of God that hath not reference to one of thoſe petitions.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt himſelf kindled this heat in us when he taught us to pray to our father, <hi>fiat voluntas tua,</hi> thy Will be done: for we may tarry the leaſure of the <hi>fiat</hi> in faith, and yet deſire it with fervency; for in nothing do we more declare our concurrence with the will of God, then in our earneſtneſſe in prayer to him to fulfill his Will.</p>

                  <p>And needfull is this comfort now; for though our Church by the good favour of God do enjoy the liberty of the Word in peace, under the gracious government of our King, whom God hath annoynted defender of the Faith:</p>

                     <hi>Verſ. 4.</hi> Behold his ſoule which is lifted up is not upright in him: But the just ſhall live by his faith.</head>
                  <p>GOd having directed the Prophet concerning the Viſion in the two former verſes, 1. For the Publication, and then for the expectation thereof; He cometh now to the Viſion it ſelfe, which containeth <hi>A Declaration of his holy Will in his general Adminiſtration of Juſtice,</hi> and ſo doth not only ſerve thoſe times and perſons preſent, but may be extended to all times and perſons ſo long as the world endureth.</p>
                  <p>And Gods ſhewing hereof maketh it a Viſion to his Prophet, and ſo to his Church, and ſo it begins at <hi>Behold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the anſwer of God doth firſt prevent an objection which might ariſe out of Gods former words; for when he ſaith of the viſion, <hi>that the time is appointed for it, and though it tarry, the Church muſt wait:</hi> as implying that it might be long before it were fullfilled; the Prophet might enquire; but what ſhall the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104898:103"/>People do in the mean time? how ſhall the afflicted hold out till that time appointed?</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the reſt of the chapter,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. He cleareth that objection, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.</item>
                     <item>2. He revealeth the Proceedings of his Juſtice, againſt ſundry ſins in all the reſt of the chapter.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the firſt let us examine the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold.</hi> Here he openeth the eyes and cleareth the ſight of the Prophet, and of the Church to ſee the Viſion, requiring us to take the matter into ſerious conſideration, as the Apoſtle ſaith, Conſider what I ſay. <hi>Let him that hath ears to heare, hear what the Spirit ſpeaketh unto the Churches;</hi> ſo is this word often uſed in Scripture to move attention.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His ſoule which is liſted up in him is not upright.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Interpreters do two ways underſtand theſe words, either thus, <hi>He that is not upright, his ſoul is lifted up;</hi> or by Converſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that is lifted up is not upright.</hi> This laſt we follow, and this I take to be Gods meaning.</p>
                  <p>It is true in the firſt ſenſe that the ungodly man ſeeketh truſt elſewhere then in God, and doth ſtrengthen himſelfe in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or pride of his heart.</p>
                  <p>But God would ſhew here that whoſoever is thus big-ſwoln in the pride of his heart, hath not <hi>rectam animam,</hi> ſome read <hi>qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etam</hi> or <hi>tranquillam animam,</hi> a right or a quiet ſoule.</p>
                  <p>It agreeth well with the Prophets complaint of the inſolenty of the Chaldaeans, that they being now lifted up with the glory of their many victories, their ſouls are not upright; wherein he declareth them horrible offenders, and therefore obnoxious to his high diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Calv.</hi> doth underſtand this place thus, that God declareth his juſt judgment againſt the Chaldaeans, that becauſe they have tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in themſelves, they ſhall have no peace in their ſouls, but ſome new ſuſpicions ſhall ſtill ariſe to diſquiet them, or new hopes to put them on upon freſh adventures, or ſome new fears to diſcrefiate them, ſo that they ſhall never reſt in their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> and <hi>Ribera</hi> a Jeſuit do both follow a corrupt Tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ecce qui incredulus eſt non erit recta anima ejus.</hi> Whereas he
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:104898:103"/>ſpeaketh not of unbelief, but of pride of heart which yet doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude infidelity, becauſe ſuch do tranſlate the truſt that they ought to place in God alone unto themſelves, and their owne means of accompliſhing their intendments: but our reading doth much better agree with our copy.</p>
                  <p>It followeth in the ſecond part of the Antitheſis, <hi>But the juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here let me firſt tell you that this ſentence is cited in the New Teſtament often.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Rom. 2.17. <hi>As it is written, the juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Galat. 3.11. <hi>But that no man is juſtified by the law in the ſight of God, it is evident; for the juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Heb. 10.37. <hi>For yet a little while, and he yet ſhall come, will come and will not tarry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="38">38. <hi>Now the juſt ſhall live by faith, and if any man ſhall draw back, my ſoule ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all theſe foure places the words have one and the ſame ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>The juſt man, that is, he who is juſtified by a ſaving faith, ſhall be ſupported by that faith; ſo as whatſoever either outward or inward calamities ſhall aſſault him, his faith ſhall carry him through all: becauſe putting his truſt only in God, in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, he ſhal have peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſhall take all that befals him in good part. So then, 1. By the juſt, we do underſtand not any legal righteouſneſſe, ſuch as ſtandeth in the performance of obedience to the whole law; which no man but Chriſt, God and man could perform: but an Evangelical righteouſneſſe, which doth conſiſt in a godly zeal, and holy endeavour of obedience to the law, according to the meaſure of that grace which God hath given to men, and whereunto is joyned both repentance of all ſins, and an holy ſorrow that we do come ſo ſhort of that full obedience, which in duty we do owe to God.</p>
                  <p>And where he ſaith <hi>vivet</hi> he ſhall live, he doth mean both a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, a ſpiritual and an eternal life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A natural life; for faith doth make that to be a life which elſe were a death; for the wicked are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; ſo Chriſt ſaith, <hi>let the dead bury their dead,</hi> and the wanton wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:104898:104"/>are ſaid to be dead even whileſt they live. But by faith our natural life hath life put into it, as the Apoſtle ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the life which I now live in the fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                     <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himſelf for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſurely this comfort muſt be applied in my text, ſo, though not ſo only, to cheer the natural life of the diſtreſſed Jews, againſt the many oppreſſions of the Chaldaeans, that their faith in the promiſe of God muſt be their life, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I had verily fainted, but that I believed to ſee the goodneſſe of God in the land of the living.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There faith preſerved the natural life of <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This includeth alſo a ſpiritual life, which is the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſoule with God by Jeſus Chriſt; for what doth quicken us but our faith? for by faith Chriſt dwelleth in us, and by faith we are rooted and grounded in him.<note place="margin">Eph. 3.17 Col. 2, 7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. This includeth an eternal life: for how do we come to be where Chriſt is, but by faith? Chriſt firſt teſtifieth of the faith of his Church, then he prayeth: <hi>Father, I will that they which thou haſt given me, may be with me, that they may behold the glory that I had with thee, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They that overcome this world do overcome it by faith, and ſuch as have this faith do grow boyſterous and violent, <hi>They take the Kingdome of God perforce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this perchance gave occaſion to the various lection, ſome reading in the preſent <hi>vivit</hi> doth live, ſome in the future <hi>vivet,</hi> ſhall live; ſome underſtanding the natural and ſpiritual only, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers only the eternal life.</p>
                  <p>But I underſtand the promiſe extended as the Apoſtle ſaith, to both; for godlineſſe hath the promiſes of this life, and that which is to come.</p>
                  <p>This ſheweth what is meant here by faith, not the hiſtorical faith, by which we underſtand what the Will of God is.</p>
                  <p>Not a temporary faith, which truſteth in God for a time, and after falleth off from him.</p>
                  <p>Not the faith of miracles which even ſome wicked Perſons whom Chriſt will not know at the day of judgement had.</p>
                  <p>Not the faith of hypocrites which ſeemeth and is not; but a juſtifying and ſaving faith. For we muſt live by the ſame faith
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:104898:104"/>here by which we muſt be ſaved hereafter.</p>
                  <p>And this faith is called the ground of things hoped for.</p>

                  <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of the word <hi>fides</hi> ſaith, <hi>Duae ſyllabae ſonant: Fides, prima à facto, ſecunda à dicto,</hi> which may have a double conſtruction.</p>

                  <p>I will not conceal from you the diſſection of this word <hi>Fides,</hi> as a witty Ancient hath anatomized it into five ſeveral letters, by which he collecteth the ingredients which muſt meet in a ſaving faith.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>I,</hi> this importeth <hi>Integritatem,</hi> Integrity, which doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it ſelfe in believing all the Articles of Chriſtian faith, for that faith which is not entire doth not hold faſt, and there is no truſting to it.</p>

                     <hi>for our faith must work through love;</hi> And Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mors fidei eſt ſeparatio cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis,</hi> faith without love is dead. And again he ſaith, <hi>ut vivat fides tua, fidem tuam dilectio animet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the ſchoole, that faith which is not joyned with love, is called <hi>fides informis,</hi> an unformed faith.</p>
                  <p>It is St. <hi>Augustines,</hi> ſaying. <hi>Cum dilectione fides eſt Chriſtiani, ſine dilectione fides eſt daemonis.</hi>

                  <p>Yet as light as they make of this pollution; it is no way to be purged but by the blood of Chriſt; and Chriſt is anſwerable to the Father and to the juſtice of his Law, even for the leaſt of theſe. Therefore the Prophet ſaith, <hi>God laid upon him the iniquity of us all, and all our ſins met in him;</hi> this cannot but include veniall ſins, for the elect have no mortal ſins.</p>
                  <p>Yet our tenet is, that all, even the leaſt obliquity of thought, <hi>primi motus ad peccata ſunt peccata,</hi> the firſt motions to ſinne are ſins, and directly againſt the tenth Commandment; and he that breaketh the leaſt of the ten is guilty of all, for he breaketh the Law.</p>
                  <p>So then the veniality of ſin is not in the nature and merit of

                  <p>And we that are his ſouldiers, who muſt <hi>ambulare ſicut ille,</hi> walk as he, we are taught by the Apoſtle, <hi>both to get and put on this righteouſneſſe as a Breſt plate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The benefits that this righteouſneſſe doth bring with it, are many.</p>

                  <p>In our minds we ſhall ſerve the law of God, and this will keep our heads always above water, that though we be put to it to ſtrive and labour hard for life in the deep waters, both of temptations and afflictions, yet through many dangers and painful ſtruglings, we ſhall at length recover the ſhore.</p>
                  <p>The diſtreſt conſcience troubled with the terrour of ſin, though it cannot eſcape Satans ſifting, and buffeting, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet can it not fall into final deſpair, becauſe this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe cannot be loſt.</p>

                  <p>So much of it as is ours is foul, and immerent, deſerving no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at the hand of God.</p>
                  <p>We have two things to do.</p>
                  <list>

                  <p>We are broken for the debt; our righteouſneſſe cometh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing near the clearing of the debt; and can we hope of doing any thing toward the purchaſe?</p>
                  <p>Nature it ſelf cannot wiſh them more unhappy then they are, that truſt in their own righteouſneſſe; for the reed they lean up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will firſt wound them, and then break under them.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Yea beloved, I dare go ſo farre, and I am ſure that I tread on ground that will carry me through, it is not faith, it is ſin, it is preſumption to truſt in the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt onely, without a care and conſcience, and practiſe of righteouſneſſe in our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>For Chriſt redeemeth us, not to idleneſſe, but to work out our ſalvation, we are delivered from the hands of our enemies, <hi>ut ſerviamus ei;</hi> that we might ſerve him; redemption doth not deſtroy, but renew our creation; and <hi>we were created to good works,</hi> and we are called to holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Let no man think that Chriſt needeth the help of our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to ſatisfie his Father; but we do need our righteouſneſſe to declare our faith in Chriſt, and to make application of the righteouſneſſe of God to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Though the full ſtrength of Scripture be bent againſt merit of righteouſneſſe, there is no ground there for idleneſſe to ſtand upon; we muſt not caſt all upon Chriſt, and make him who came to redeeme us from the puniſhment of our evil works, a redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of us from the neceſſity of good works:</p>
                  <p>Our very union with him is enough to neceſſitate operative; righteouſnes for he ſaith, <hi>My Father worketh as yet, &amp; ego operor,</hi> and I work; and it is his word, <hi>thus muſt we fulfil all righteouſnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore that Chriſt may ſee he paid the debt for ſuch as would have paid it if they could, and did their beſt to pay all, let us not neglect our own righteouſneſſe in our queſt of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but being only by Jeſus Chriſt delivered from the hands of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:104898:113"/>our enemies, let us ſerve him in righteouſneſſe and holyneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him all the days of our life.</p>

                     </note> that ſeeing the neceſſity of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, we do look well to the integrity thereof, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle admoniſheth us in his teſtimony of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>

                  <p>This righteouſneſſe is not for ſhew, but for ſervice.</p>
                  <p>There be ſome temptations that take their aime at us, and come forth to aſſault us; there be others that are ſhot at random, and yet may hit us.

                  <p n="1">1. The Author.</p>
                  <p>We muſt go to him from whom every good and perfect gift doth proceed, to ſeek faith.</p>
                  <p>Here I muſt admoniſh you that faith is given without ſeeking at firſt; for it is a free gift, and it is the glory of God; <hi>I am found of them that ſought me not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do not think that the gift of faith is acquired; that is freely given; but the encreaſe of our faith is acquired by means. I prove it thus.</p>
                  <p>The ſpirit of God is given in the wombe, it is given to infants; therefore faith is alſo given; for the ſpirit is never unfruitful, and faith is one of the fruits of the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Apoſtles ſaid unto the Lord, encreaſe our faith.</hi> The grace of God which moveth in the generation of them that fear the Lord, is the ſeed of all vertues, and firſt of faith the mother vertue which iſſueth all the reſt; that is given early. And the gift of faith doth ſo lie hid in the Elect of God, that themſelves know not of it, till God be pleaſed not to put his ſonne into them, but to reveal his Sonne in them.</p>
                  <p>This magnifieth the free grace of God, and teacheth us to ſay, <hi>It is ſo father becauſe thy good pleaſure is ſuch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this excludeth all boaſting on our part, ſeeing we have it of meer and free gift. And it aſcribeth the glory of all to God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The means to get faith.</p>
                  <p>Theſe as I have ſaid do not lay the foundation of faith in us, that is the free gift of God: but theſe means do advance the building, they do help to encreaſe our faith.</p>

                  <p>So that for the encreaſing of faith ſhe heard the word; and the more ſhe believed, the more attentively ſhe heard, and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of faith ſhe was baptized. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing; for how ſhall they believe on him of whom they have not heard?</hi> Here let me admoniſh you;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But when I ſay by the word with the Apoſtle, I do underſtand, and would be underſtood to ſpeak of the Word, not as it is the voice of a mortal man, nor as it is a dead letter, but as the ſpirit doth ſpeak to us in the Word.</p>
                  <p>For this the Apoſtle biddeth us, <hi>Be ſwift to hear</hi> it concerns us much: but that you may ſee that faith is not begotten in us by hearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hearing doth us no good without faith, and we muſt have a grain of faith to ſeaſon our hearing, or elſe our hearing will adde nothing to our faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The word preached did not profit them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hebr. 4.2.</note> 
                     <hi>not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So do we ſee ſome at firſt poure water into a Pumpe, to ſet it a work, that it may yield water plenteouſly; for faith poured into our hearing doth make our hearing bring forth more faith.</p>
                  <p>And ſo in Prayer. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> ſaith of faith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Incipit infundi ut incipiat poſci.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man cannot have faith without asking, neither can he aske it without faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When I name the word for a means to beget an increaſe of faith, I mean the written word, to exclude all unwritten traditions and all written legends which the tel-tale Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath coyned to gull the ſwallowing credulity of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:104898:116"/>ignorants; that is, the books of Canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, of which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They are able to make a man wiſe to ſalvation, and perfect, throughly perfect to every good work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When I name the word a means of faith, I muſt mean the Word underſtood by us; for the Eunuch learns nothing of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah</hi> the Prophet by reading him without underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>And I wonder that ever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool and infatuate the judgements of men, to believe that either hearing a forme of ſervice, or praying in a ſtrange tongue, could carry any validity in them, except they did conceive, or do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ſuch hearing and praying have power of incantation.</p>
                  <p>Therefore there is required</p>
                  <p>A tranſlation of the word into our natural language, or ſome other that we underſtand, if we underſtand not the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
                  <p>And herein I muſt ſtirre you up to a thankful conſideration of their profitable labours, who have taken pains to tranſlate the Bible to Engliſh for the common benefit of you all, that you may read the Scriptures, and exerciſe your ſelves in the ſtudy of them, and examine the doctrines that you hear by them.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed be the Lord God of our fathers, who put ſuch a thing as this into the heart of our Kings Majeſty, to ſet this work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot and to ſee it finiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Herein alſo I muſt commend unto you the eaſineſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity of Scripture; for if God had not left the way of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on open, but had ſhut it up in ſuch clouds of obſcurity, that we muſt needs have a guide to light us the way to the lanthorn, why would <hi>David</hi> have called the Word it ſelfe <hi>A Lanthorne to our feet?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore let no man be diſcouraged from his own private ſtudying of Scriptures, for feare of their hardneſſe. It is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then idleneſſe and ſhuffling to ſay the Scriptures are too deep for me, I will not meddle with them.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt commandeth, <hi>Search the Scriptures:</hi> is he not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt that ſaith, do not, thou ſhalt not ſearch?</p>
                  <p>I ſay and believe that the Word only read over by us or to us, without the help of any Comment, or Sermon, or Expoſition of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:104898:116"/>it is a Lanthorne, and giveth light to the ſimple.</p>
                  <p>Much more the Word with good Commentaries and written Expoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Much more the Word preached by learned and judicious Preachers, which know how to divide the ſame aright; thoſe be called fellow-labourers with God, Angels of God, the ſalt of the earth, the light of the world, and even Saviours of men, and becauſe of their labour in the Word, and overſight of the People, honour, double honour is allowed to them by the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This point is of great uſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To us that are Miniſters of the Word; for it layeth a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon us, and wo be to us if we preach not the Goſpel.</p>

                  <p>God hath given and committed to us the Miniſtry of the Word of faith, by which we muſt live; and if we be not found faithful in the diſpenſation thereof, our ſouls ſhall anſwer for the ſins of the People, which are committed by our negligence, and for want of our giving warning.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To you it is a provocation of you to be ſwift to hear, to take heed how you heare, to heare with meekneſſe, to hear wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, to hear attentively, to meditate in the Word that you hear, to ſearch the Scriptures, to believe the word ſpoken, to be obedient to the forme of doctrine delivered, not to deſpiſe him that ſpeaketh in our miniſtry; it is ſaid of <hi>Lydia that ſhe heard us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the outward means of her ſaith. This had never done good alone; for he that planteth is nothing, and he that water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is nothing, but God that giveth the increaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He is nothing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that planteth,</hi> that is, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Word is nothing.</p>
                  <p>There were two things much amiſſe amongſt the Corinthians at that time.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One was. they did too much depend upon their Miniſters,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:104898:117"/>and aſcribe too much to them, wherein he that ſent them had wrong.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They were partial in their eſtimation of their Miniſters, ſome affecting and preferring one, ſome another, that it came to a ſchiſme.</p>
                  <p>To remove which double diſeaſe in the Church, the Apoſtle telleth them, that the Miniſter is not any thing: his meaning is not to diſgrace the Ordinance of God, to defile his own neſt, to diſhonour his own high-calling, but to bring them to true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, and to let them underſtand that the Miniſtry of men is outward, that God hath no need of it, he can convert and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ſouls without it.</p>
                  <p>And further, whatſoever the Miniſter doth, it is by the ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and help and efficacy of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>The purpoſe of the Apoſtle is to withdraw us from depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on outward means, he doth not ſeek to diſcourage the uſe or to diſparage the honour of them, or to queſtion their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: but to ſhew that as planting and watering of a tree are to the bearing of fruit, ſo is our preaching to your good life: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God do give the encreaſe, the means in it ſelfe is not any thing.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us ſearch deeper for the power of God in the increaſe of our faith, and we ſhall find it a ſpecial work of the Holy Ghoſt:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.31.</note> and ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the ſpirit of faith, doth give us to underſtand, that faith is wrought in us by that Spirit of God which bloweth where he liſteth.</p>

                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:104898:119"/>Such was man in the ſtate of innocency in reſpect of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and though his fall eclipſed that light very much, and much of that particular knowledge which <hi>Adam</hi> had, periſhed in him; yet ſure that which remained after the fall, which was the ſtock wherewith he ſet up in the world, did give the firſt rules, and lay down the grounds of all arts and ſciences, which being perfected by obſervation, ſtudy and experience in the long life of the fathers, deſcended upon ſucceeding times, like rivers which gather in ſome brooks to mend their ſtreame as they haſten to the ſea, and ſo improve their ſtrength in current, and dilate their banks.</p>
                  <p>Much of this maketh much againſt man; for in this exellencie of his knowledge extending it ſelf ſo to the creature, no doubt but he knew the Angels alſo, and knew of their fall. I cannot ſuppoſe that ſo excellent a creature as man bearing the image of God that made him, and of the Angels that ſtood and kept their firſt eſtate, could be ignorant, or that God would conceale from him ſuch an example of weakneſſe in ſo excellent a creature, of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in him.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſuppoſe but that he knew into what condition the fall of Angels had dejected them, and how farre their ſinne had corrupted them; he could not but know them, hating of, and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, and therefore no friend to man.</p>
                  <p>He might have ſuſpected the forbidden fruit to have had ſome poyſonous quality, when God ſaid, <hi>quâ die comederis morte morie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> but he knew by that full knowledge that he had of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that it was good and wholſome for meat.</p>
                  <p>But the more we honour God in the perfection of his creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the more we diſhonour man in the precipitation of his fall; ſurely he ſtumbled not, he fell not for want of light, he fell in the day, as it will after follow.</p>
                  <p>But much of this knowledge ſurvived his innocency, and no doubt but the Angels that fell had and have much more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge then men now have.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His holineſſe was alſo compleat; for that Maker is not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>imperfecti operis,</hi> of an imperfect work; he did nothing but it was <hi>bonum valde,</hi> very good; ſurely I doubt not to affirme that there was as full and as great perfection of holineſſe
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:104898:119"/>and righteouſneſſe in <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of his innocencie as was in Jeſus Chriſt, for God was well pleaſed in them both.</p>
                  <p>The difference was this, <hi>Adam</hi> was a meer creature, and his height of honour was the image of his Maker; but Chriſt was man not united by way of ſimilitude with the image of God, but by way of perſonal union with the nature of the Godhead, ſo that <hi>Adams</hi> holineſſe was changable, but Chriſts holineſſe was not.</p>
                  <p>This holineſſe and righteouſneſſe conſiſted in a ſincere purity of the creature within himſelf, and in a totall conformity to the will of God.</p>
                  <p>The exaltation of Gods favour to him went no higher; ſo high it did go; <hi>Adam</hi> might have kept him ſo to this day and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver if he would.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this mutability in the ſtate of man, was, becauſe he was made of earth, which was made of nothing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not participate of the immutability of God as it did of his goodneſſe and holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering man thus in his ſtate of innocency, we ſhall finde that all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity was then in him, and in his perſon was the whole nature of mankinde; ſo that the whole nature either ſtood or fell in him, and was either in his ſtanding to hold the innocency of creation, or in his fall to loſe the ſame.</p>
                  <p>By this light we ſee the goodneſſe, and love, and wiſdome of God in the creation of man, and here is the ground laid of his juſtice alſo; for there is no neceſſity laid upon man that he muſt fall; and being thus ſet up, he cannot break but by his own ill husbandry of the talent of grace that is given to him; for what would he have more? God may ſay of this Vine, <hi>what could I have done more to it then I did?</hi> he may be eternally and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changably happy if he will.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>This is called Originall ſin; becauſe it runneth in the ſame ſtream with our bloud, and we derive it from our faulty progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours; which the Apoſtle calleth, <hi>The ſin that hangeth ſo fast on;</hi>

                  <p>Theſe are not only ſins in <hi>proventu ex corde,</hi> but <hi>in corde,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith, out of the heart cometh murther, adultery, theft.</p>

                  <p>True; it cannot finally be loſt, it is aſſured to God; but we muſt preſerve it, ſo as that in temptations and afflictions we may not be caſt down with fear that it is loſt.</p>

                  <p>Therefore we are bound to the uſe of all thoſe means ordained by God to preſerve faith.</p>
                  <p>If it be an hypocritical or a temporary Faith, it may be loſt; if it be a true Faith, this is one certain ſign of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſame means that breede Faith in us, the ſame means do nouriſh it: therefore</p>

                  <p>And many falſe ſhewes are made out of Scriptures not rightly underſtood, to maintain this hereſie.</p>
                  <p>I ſay no more, but as the Apoſtle doth,</p>
                  <p>

                           <item>2. By the vertue of conſignation, becauſe theſe Sacraments are
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:104898:126"/>the Seals of Gods Covenant of grace, obliging God the giver to continue his love to us, and reciprocally binding us to return du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and love and obedience to him.</item>
                           <item>3. By the efficacy of mediation, becauſe they be the means in the Ordinance of God, whereby he doth convey his ſpiritual gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to us, ſo that Baptiſm is called the cover of regeneration, and by Baptiſm Chriſt is put on.</item>

                  <p>The Supper of Chriſt preſenteth Chriſt to us our ſpiritual food, and therein we do eat and drink his body and blood.</p>
                  <p>This admoniſheth us to be ſwift to hear, and to neglect no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>To renew our Baptiſm by often repentance, to frequent the Table of the Lord, as the feaſt of our ſouls.</p>

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>Sathan knowing that our Faith makes us too ſtrong for him, and quencheth all his fiery darts. doth therefore all he can to keep us from the means by which Faith is increaſed in us.</p>
                  <p>That is, from hearing the Word and receiving the Sacrament, from meditation, from prayer; and as often as you find your ſelves tempted to neglect theſe, know it to be Sathans malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you to keep you from Faith.</p>
                  <p>The breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe without a ſheild of Faith, is not ſufficient to keep off the fiery darts of Sathan from wounding us, but Faith quencheth them.</p>

                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:104898:130"/>They therefore that live in the love and in the uſe of thoſe means, may comfort themſelves that Sathan ſhall not be able to hinder them from obtaining a comfortable vegetation and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in Faith.</p>

                  <p>And whereas he laboureth to wreſt our Faith from us, we ſhall find that both his cunning and ſtrength will fail him, for ſaving Faith cannot be loſt.</p>
                  <p>To eſtabliſh our Faith, let us know that imperfect Faith may be a ſound and true Faith; for we cannot attain to perfection in this life, but if we have a good conſcience in all things, willing to live honeſtly,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.18</note> we may have boldneſſe with God.

                  <p>Our obedience and good works are the fruits of Faith, we live by Faith, Faith lives in obedience, for without works Faith is dead: Did we but know the unvaluable price of Faith, we would ſeek it more then all other things, and like the Merchant in the Parable,<note place="margin">Mat. 13 44</note> we would part with all we have to purchaſe Faith.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ribera</hi> a learned Ieſuite, when he cometh to this Text in his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:104898:130"/>full commentary upon this Prophet, ſaith. <hi>Incidimus in locum qui eſt lapis offenſionis duabus domibus</hi> Iſraelis, <hi>hoc est orthodoxis, &amp; haereticis qui receſſerunt à domo</hi> David.</p>
                  <p>It greives the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that we have ſo clear a Text in th is Prophet, and that ſo much urged in the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles for our juſtification by Faith alone; and <hi>Ribera</hi> is much deceived if he mean us under the tittle of haeretiques; for this place is no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to us: It is the moſt comfortable doctrine that we can em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, nothing doth more ſet forth the excellency of Faith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth more aſſure to us our eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Fain would <hi>Ribera</hi> have ſhifted off the clear evidence of this place with this illuſion, that the Prophets meaning is this,</p>
                  <p>The juſt man, that is, the man that deſireth to be juſt, ſhall live the life of grace by the Faith whith he hath in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>We underſtand that a man is juſtified only by Faith, and that without the Law as the Apoſtle doth alſo teach.</p>
                  <p>And it were a poor comfort to the Church in their diſtreſſe to tell them, that the juſt man ſhould live by his Faith, except the Lord in that promiſe did aſſure them the comforts, not only of the naturall, but of the ſpirituall and eternal life</p>
                  <p>Neither would the Apoſtle urge this Text, but with theſe contents. For exexamine the places where theſe words are urged, and it wil appear.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle profeſſeth.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.17</note>

                  <p>The Goſpel is ſaid to reveal the righteouſneſſe of God, he cannot mean the eſſential righteouſneſſe by which God is juſtice it ſelf in his divine nature; but he doth underſtand that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>who is made unto us wiſdom, Righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt our Righteouſneſſe:</hi> and this is called the grace of God which bringeth ſalvation</p>
                  <p>This is revealed now in the cleare light of the Goſpel in real performance, which was before exhibited in viſions and dreams, and types and ceremonies whilſt the veyle was up.</p>

                  <p>For how can the Goſpel be the power of God to ſalvation, except it revealeth to us the life of ſaith, ſeeing it is ſo only to ſuch as do believe?</p>
                  <p>This firſt place cleareth the point, that the Apoſtle doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Gods word in my text ſo, as that the means of life is faith, and faith only: for ſo it is further urged by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith,</p>
                  <q>But that no man is juſtified by the works of the law in the ſight of God,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.11.</note> is evident; for the juſt ſhall live by faith.</q>
                  <p>Here theſe words are brought in to prove, that faith only doth juſtifie in the ſight of God; which is thus proved.</p>

                  <p>That which the Romaniſts do lay to our charge, is, that we exclude good works, and upon that ſlanderous imputation, both Dr. <hi>Stapleton, Harding, Bellarmine, Campiane, Biſhop,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed generally all Popiſh writers do proclaim us Hereticks, and they will not hear us, ſaying, that the juſtifying faith which we preach, muſt be ſuch as worketh by love.</p>
                  <p>They like the Phariſee truſt in themſelves that they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; we with the Publican, cry out in faith of Chriſt's ſufficient ſatisfaction, <hi>Domine miſerere,</hi> Lord have mercy; upon whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith;</p>
                  <q>Videte fratres, magis placuit humilitas in malis factis, quam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbia in bonis factis.</q>
                  <p>The cauſe is in ſight; the humility of the one was with faith, the pride of the other was in preſumption: <hi>And God reſisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I conclude this point, wherein I have held you long; I know with how much comfort and profit to my ſelf, I hope without your loſſe of time. What man is he that deſireth life, who would live as a man, as a good man, and as an happy man? I anſwer in the words of the Sonne of God; <hi>As thou believeſt, ſo ſhall it be unto thee.</hi> Or in the Words of the Father of that Son in my text.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Here be three words to expreſſe pride fully:
<list>
                        <item>1. To think too well of our ſelves.</item>
                        <item>2. To think contemptibly of others.</item>
                        <item>3. To boaſt and glory in vain oſtentation.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeemeth to me that the purpoſe of this place, is to expreſſe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:104898:132"/>the inſolency and pride of the king of <hi>Babel,</hi> proud <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> and generally of the enemy of the Jew, the Chaldaean; and that the ſcope of the place is to reſemble them big ſwoln in their own ſelf-opinion, to a man that is drunk with wine.</p>
                  <p>This hath good coherence with the former words, for ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how the juſt man and the proud man do ſtand in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His ſoule which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the juſt ſhall live by faith; faith ſhall eſtabliſh the juſt man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the proud man who is drunk with the vain over-weening of himſelf, he ſhall not continue, <hi>non habitabit,</hi> he ſhall not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>And here I forſake the Kings Bible, for I cannot find either ſenſe or coherence in it.</p>
                  <p>The words following are plain enough; for God therein doth expreſſe that he taketh notice of the inſatiable deſire of the Chaldaean, who incouraged by his victories, doth covet to be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of all the world.</p>
                  <p>And this is now the partition of the reſt of this chapter.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The ground and note of this diſeaſe of infatiableneſſe, is pride of heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The diſeaſe it ſelf, is infatiableneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of the ground: it is pride.</p>
                  <p>This is reſembled to drunkenneſſe, it is a ſpiritual giddineſſe, wherein men loſe themſelves, and as the drunkard doth both think and ſpeak, and do thoſe things which betoken madneſſe, his reaſon, and underſtanding, and judgment, and memory fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is wholly governed by his fancy: ſo the proud man made drunk with the wine of his over weening, as a man beſide himſelf, is tranſported with his own ſelf-opinion,<note place="margin">Iſa. 28.1.</note> to do things unſeemly as the drunkard doth.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet reproving the pride of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> doth uſe this reſemblance,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wo to the Crowne of Pride, the drunkards of</hi> Ephraim. And again,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:104898:133"/>Ver. 3. <hi>The Crown of Pride, the drunkards of</hi> Ephraim <hi>ſhall be troden underfoot.</hi> And after,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus doth pride rob us of our wits, and we ſay of the proud man; that he doth not know himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Wine and ſtrong drink moderately taken do comfort the heart of man, but when we over-drink, we ceaſe to be our ſelves; ſo is it with ſelf love: for every man by the law of charity is bound to love himſelf, and to love himſelf firſt; when this love doth not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overflow the banks, it is charity; when it exuberateth, it is pride.</p>
                  <p>All ſober men do eſteem drunkards vile, and account drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe a loathſome ſin; let the proud man ſee himſelf in that glaſſe, for the drunkard is the picture of the proud man.</p>

                  <p>His eldeſt ſon hath fairly dilated his empire; we know that in 88. he had not enough, he would have faine been dividing of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi> and meating out the valley of <hi>Succoth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In inferiour places, how are men tranſported with deſire of power and command, and how unſatiable in that deſire? witneſſe the many offices, the various employments, which ſome have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and obtained to be congeſted on them.</p>
                  <p>I ſay no more of this unſatiable gulf of deſire, then my text ſaith, it is like two things that they love not, Hell and Death.</p>
                  <p>Death is not ſatisfied but with all; it is named laſt in my text, as the greedieſt of the two; hell deſires all the ungodly of the earth, it is a pit digged for the ungodly.</p>
                  <p>But death ſwalloweth all; <hi>Statutum est omnibus ſemel mori,</hi> what man liveth and ſhall not ſee death? So inſatiable is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of power.</p>
                  <p>This reſemblance doth ſhake the ſtrength of that deſire much, if we think upon it well, I labour and ſtrive to get many under my command, and death is labouring together with me to bring me to the grave; and if I do not uſe my power to the glory of God, and the good of my brethren, hell is as buſie and as greedy to devour me.</p>
                  <p>This is one of the crying ſins of our Land, inſatiable pride;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:104898:135"/>this makes dear rents, and great fines, this takes away the whole cloathing of many poore; to adde one Lace more in the ſuits of the rich; this ſhortens the labourers wages, and addes much to the burthen of his labour. This greedineſſe makes the market of ſpiritual and temporal offices and dignities, and puts well-deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vertue out of countenance.</p>
                  <p>This corrupts Religion with opinions, juſtice with bribes, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with cruelty; it turns peace into ſchiſme and contention, love into complement, friendſhip into treaſon, and ſets the mouth of hell yet more open, and gives it a new appetite for more ſouls.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of all, is the doctrine of contentation, as we profeſſe, that we have our being, not of our ſelves, but of God; <hi>In him we live, move, and have our being; He made us, and not we our ſelves;</hi> ſo let us be content with his proviſion for us.</p>
                  <p>It was Satans firſt ſuggeſtion to <hi>Adam;</hi> for ſo he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted himſelf, and loſt his firſt eſtate; to ſuggeſt pride he would ſhew man a way how to be like God, and then all the fruits in the garden would not content him, he muſt taſte alſo of the forbidden fruit.</p>

                  <p>Pride maketh us ſhift for our ſelves, and divideth us from God: he offereth his wings to ſuch, and they will not be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

                  <p>In anſwer to all theſe objections, put the caſe how you will, I am ſure God is juſt, and will neither himſelf puniſh, nor cauſe, nor ſuffer any to puniſh, but where ſo much puniſhment is well deſerved.</p>
                  <p>Peradventure he that inflicteth the puniſhment may offend in it, and there may be a fault done in the manner of it; or that for which the puniſhment is inflicted may be no juſt cauſe, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be miſtaken; but ſtill I ſay God is juſt, <hi>ſubeſt culpa,</hi> there is a fault; the hand of God, the will of God is in every puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they never do any thing without the juſtice of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> that juſtified his integrity ſo ſtoutly, as we read in his ſtory, did never deny himſelf to be a grievous ſinner, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the puniſhment that he ſuffered, though he ſtill did ſtand upon it, that he was not therefore puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>If the puniſhment be for tryall, the gold that is tried will be divided from the droſſe, and that droſſe deſerveth a melting.</p>
                  <p>If the puniſhment be for example, know that God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give ſo ill example as to puniſh an innocent.</p>
                  <p>If men do like men in execution of Gods judgments; know that God knows why he ſuffereth them ſo to do, for he ſearcheth the hearts and reins.</p>

                  <p>For the breach of one Commandment doth diſtaſte all the reſt of our obedience, as a little leaven ſowreth the whole lump, therefore though we cannot ſay that he which breaketh the Sabbath committeth adultery, or that he that ſtealeth is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer; yet we may ſay that he that doth break the leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the law, is guilty of the breach of the whole law in omiſſion, though not in Commiſſion, ſeeing the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that the law requireth, failing in one duty corrupteth all that we do, ſay or think.</p>
                  <p>Let us now behold the concurrence of ſins in the Chaldaean, and begin</p>
                  <p n="1">1. At his incredulity, for he would be delivered from evil, but he truſteth not God with it, but goeth his own way to it.</p>
                  <p>This is the mother ſinne of all evil ways and means unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed to accompliſh mens ends here on earth; diſtruſt in God.</p>
                  <p>For when we uſe fraud, and lying, and diſſembling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing of the truth, and bind untruths with oaths, to gain cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to what we ſay untruly; when we make no conſcience of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:104898:146"/>which may be hidden with cunning, or born out with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, all this proceeds from diſtruſt in God.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we grow guilty of the two great evils of which God himſelf complaineth;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For my People have committed two evils, they have forſaken me the fountain of living waters,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 2.13.</note> 
                     <hi>and hewed them out ciſterns, broken ciſterns that can hold no water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again this, <hi>Take heed leaſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 3.12</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The heart that diſtruſteth in God, departeth from him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>it is a People that do erre in their hearts, becauſe they have not known my ways.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The corruption then is in the heart; for if that did love truly, it would truſt God wholly; for where we love faithfully we truſt boldly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Infidelity is the root of all evils in us; for we cannot fear any threatning, where we do not believe any danger.</p>
                  <p>We cannot hope for any benefit where we do not believe any promiſe; for infidelity doth take away all wiſe do me from us.</p>
                  <p>This makes us to withdraw our ſelves from the Lord, and it is a note of the wicked man, <hi>neither is God in all his wayes.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Chaldaeans truſt not in God: their own net is their god, their own yarn is their idol, they kiſſe their own hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But fear yee the Lord all his Saints, and truſt in him, for he never faileth them that truſt in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have blamed ſome for buying and ſelling on the Sabbah; They have anſwered that they are poor and are forced to it, to help to feed them.</p>
                  <p>Is not this infidelity? they dare not truſt God for their meat, they dare truſt to their own ways againſt the preciſe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
                  <p>Unlawful recreations on the Sabbath are ſo defended; poor labouring men that work all the ſix days, muſt have ſome time to refreſh themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But I would fain know by what indulgence they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the law of the Sabbath. God hath bidden thee to remember to keep the whole day holy: if thy recreations be holy, thou keepeſt the law; if unholy, thou breakeſt it.</p>
                  <p>When ſome are detected of fraud and theft, their plea is their
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:104898:147"/>neceſſity. Here is a root of infidelity: for doth God lay a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity upon any man to break his law?</p>
                  <p>He hath laid on thee a neceſſity of labour; if that will not do, he hath given the rich charge of thee.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, that this root of infidelity doth yet remain in the hearts of moſt of us, and is the cauſe of all the ſins that are committed.</p>
                  <p>For the light of the Goſpel doth ſhine much more clear now then ever it did in this land, and the knowledge of the truth is more ſpred then ever before here.</p>
                  <p>Yet never was there greater corruption of manners, nor more cunning ſhifts deviſed for the advancing of mens parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>The crying ſins of the Jews,</p>
                  <p>Injuries done between man and man.</p>
                  <p>Corruption and contempt of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Corruption of Juſtice. To all theſe our land doth plead guilty. Where's the fault?</p>
                  <p>Have you not heard? have you not been taught the ways of the Lord? have you not been admoniſh't of your duty? have you not been chidden, and threatned for theſe things? hath not the ſeal of Gods judgments written within and without with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, mourning and wo, been opened and read to you?</p>
                  <p>Hath not God rained examples thick of his juſtice and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt high and low for theſe things? why then is not this amended?</p>

                  <p>Ambition is a limbe of pride, and it is well ſet forth in my text, it is a building of a neſt on high; it is but a neſt that the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious man doth ſet up, but he would have it high to overlook all; yet that doth not make it ſafe; for there be clouds that can carry fire from below to conſume it, and there is lightning from above to inflame it, and there is tempeſts and ſtrong winds to ſhake it.</p>
                  <p>And the axe is laid to the root of the tree in which the neſt is built, and with the fall of that tree the neſt comes to the ground.</p>
                  <p>The higheſt tree for a ſubject to build his neſt in, is the favour of the Prince; yet <hi>David</hi> ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truſt not in Princes; for there is no help in them, their breath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth, they return to the earth, and their thoughts periſh.</hi> It may be that he that fitteth next in the chair of ſoveraignty, will be no tree for the ſame birds to build in.</p>
                  <p>Ambition is an inordinate deſire of honour.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> hath a rule which would ſtop the mouth of ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and competitors for honour. <hi>Locus regiminis deſiderantibus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Naturally the love that every man beareth to himſelf, and the good opinion that pride putteth into him of himſelf, doth make him deſire to ſet his neſt high, and therefore every man obſerveth the courſe of the times, in which he liveth to ſee which is the readieſt way to riſe.</p>
                  <p>The king is called the fountain of honour; for from the Ruler of the People all ſubordinations of rule derive themſelves; and therefore</p>

                  <p>The way of preferment is ſoon found, and ambition hath a foot for it: The Prophets phraſe, <hi>Pes ſuperbiae,</hi> the foot of pride.</p>
                  <p>If only vertue were the way, only vertue would be ſtudied.</p>
                  <p>But I look not ſo low as the Throne of earthly Princes for

                  </p>
                  <p>Many are ambitious of high places, who have both friends and means, and yet cannot climbe; Many more unlikely ſpeed before them, and I can aſcribe this to nothing but the ſupream hand of God, from whom all promotion cometh, he will have his Will done.</p>
                  <p>Some he raiſeth to their own ruine, others to the puniſhment and correction of the ſins of the time in his anger: Others for the good of men in favour of his Church, and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                  <p>It becomes not us to cenſure the Powers that are ordained of God, as the Apoſtle teacheth, or to envy their high neſts; but let every ſoul be ſubject to the ordinance of God, and reſt in his will by whom Princes reign, and by whom they advance where he pleaſeth to ſet up.</p>
                  <p>But ambition of high neſts is the theme of our diſcourſe, which is an inordinate deſire of honour, and that is a ſin.</p>

                  <p>But as ſin brought in the law, for <hi>Justo non eſt poſita lex:</hi> ſo ſin brought in Magiſtracy for execution of the law, and brought down the ſword of God amongſt men: and the equal conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mankind in his Creation by ſinne was changed into male and female: not in ſexe, but in ſubjection, high and low, rich and poor, bond and free.</p>
                  <p>So that this ambition of an higher neſt came in with ſinne; and being ſo brought in at firſt, it cannot be without ſin.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpeaks bugs words.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> complains of nothing more then that he was made a Biſhop; He was an holy man, but a man, and his paſſion tranſported him.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But howſoever his humility unworthied him to himſelf, it was Gods great bleſſing to his Church not only then, but in all ſucceeding ages that God ſo promoted him.</p>
                  <p>One thing amongſt the reſt maketh ambition an unmanly ſin: for two contraries meet in the ambitious, that is, pride and a baſe mind. Pride ſtriving to climb high, and a baſe mind ſervilely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the means of riſing, waiting and obſerving ſuch as may help him up, as one that climbeth, embraceth every bough, &amp; hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in his armes what he ſhortly treadeth under his foot.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaves me a labour, for he doth deſcribe ſuch a man to the life; <hi>Ambitioſus ſemper eſt pavidus.

                  </p>
                  <p>The end of the Chaldeans ambition to ſet his neſt ſo high, is that he may be delivered from the power of evil.</p>
                  <p>Herein is a great fallacy; for be high neſts the ſafeſt? and is
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:104898:149"/>greatneſſe ſecurity? may not we that have lived to ſee in few years great changes, ſay that high preferments be giddy and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, <hi>feriuntque ſumos fulmina montes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſons why ambition maketh men unhappy.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ground of it is pride, which is an over weening our ſelves and our own worth, and this robbeth God of glory; for <hi>quid habes quod non accepiſti?</hi> therefore God reſiſteth the proud.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The whole operation of ambition is by the wiſed ome of this world, and that is folly. <hi>Petrus Ravenna</hi> doth ſet it out well;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ambitio eſt quaedam ſimia charitatis: charitas patiens eſt pro a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternis: ambitio patitur omnia pro caducis: charitas benigna eſt pauperibus, ambitio divitibus: charitas omnia ſuffert pro veritate, Ambitiopro vanitate; utraque omnia credit, omnia ſperat, ſed diſſimili modo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is altogether uncharitable; for <hi>charitas ut teipſum:</hi> It is <hi>Jobs</hi> phraſe of the fatherleſſe, he was brought up with me as with a father, ſo doth charity bring up inferiours, and equals grow together: but ambition doth not, cannot affect <hi>magnitudinem ſuam, ſine parvitate aliena.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is before expreſt to be inſatiable; <hi>quis enim modus adſit honori?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man deſireth firſt to be eminent in the ſtreet wherein he lives, and then in the city; and yet having attained his deſire, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Navis quae in flamine magna est, in mari parvula eſt.</hi> One that is high and great in the city, in the country where he lives, in the Univerſity, let him come to the Court, and he ſhall ſee how many Spheres of greatneſſe do move above him. Here is more work for ambition; if we remember the law, <hi>proximum ut te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſum,</hi> thy neighbour as thy ſelf, we will no more deſire to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed one the other in the ſtate wherein we live, then a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth one hand or one leg, in proportion of ſtrength and bigneſſe to exceed the other in his body.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We have a fair example in our elder brother, for though he was ſuch as to whom it was ſaid, <hi>Adorent eum omnes Angeli ejus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 2.17</note> Worſhip him all ye Angels; yet to become our brother,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:104898:149"/>
                     <hi>In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He could not do this without humiliation; there was no power above him to humble him, <hi>and he thought it no robbery to be equal with God;</hi> the power that did it was in himſelf, <hi>humiliavit ſemet ipſum,</hi> he humbled himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Ambition therefore putteth us out of the way of life. Chriſt humbled himſelfe; <hi>Et qui vult eſſe diſcipulus meus ſequatur me,</hi> He that will be my diſciple muſt follow me.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine of contentedneſſe doth ſtill offer it ſelf to us commanded in the laſt of the ten: for <hi>non concupiſces aliena,</hi> faith, <hi>ſortè tua contentus,</hi> be contented with thy lot; this alſo ſerveth for the next point.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are charged with covetouſneſſe;</p>
                  <p>Of which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Take heed and beware of Covetouſneſſe,</hi> giving us a double caution againſt it.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle giveth a reaſon, becauſe it is the root of all evill but that reaſon doth not draw blood;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.10</note> for where the conſcience is not tender <hi>malum culpae,</hi> the evil of puniſhment is not feared. But it followeth.</p>
                  <p>Which while ſome have coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows.</p>
                  <p>Ambition hath this handmaid to attend it, this factour to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate for it; for ambition is not ſupported without great charge; our own times tell us ſo; and Ambition cannot be a great ſpender, if covetouſneſſe be not a great getter.</p>
                  <p>Covetouſneſſe is an inordinate deſire of the wealth of this world, and is many ways culpable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe God hath given man dominion of the earth, and hath put all things under his feet; let not us remove them, and as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, let us not <hi>Cor opponere,</hi> ſet our heart upon them.</p>
                  <p>Gold and ſilver are lower put under us then the ſurface of the earth; for they grow within the bowels of the earth nearer to hell, to ſhew the danger that is in them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Apoſtles had theſe things not put into their boſomes, or into their hands, but laid at their feet.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Scripture hath expreſled the woe of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the covetous, as you have heard, <hi>Vae homini qui congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat non ſua,</hi> wo to the man which gathereth not his own.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou makeſt him drunk that thou mayſt look on their nakednes.]</hi> For it is ſaid that the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> did uſe in his Conqueſts to bring forth great quantity of wine, and to make the People drink drunk that he might make ſport with them; for in thoſe drunken fits many ſhameful and beſtial acts of laſciviouſneſſe were publikely ſhewed, drunkenneſſe enflaming them with loſt.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> doth interpret all this figuratively, not of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe with ſtrong drink,<note place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> but of immoderate deſire of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting their dominions; of which kind of drunkenneſſe he ſpake before, comparing the Babylonians to ſuch as tranſgreſſe with wine.</p>
                  <p>So doth <hi>Ribera</hi> a learned Jeſuit underſtand this, of the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent triumph of the Babylonian King, making ſport in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Kings, and exerciſing on them cruelties, to diſcover their nakedneſſe, how he hath ſtripped them out of all.</p>
                  <p>But Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> reporteth that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did abuſe <hi>Zedechiah</hi> the King at a banquet in a very foul manner.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe that kind of drunkenneſſe was before touched to the quick, I follow <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> in the literal expoſition of theſe words, which I have before delivered, that the King made his aſſociate Kings, and his Conquered enemies drunk to make him ſport. Which ſin of his is threatned.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>Thou art filled with ſhame for glory;</hi> for this turned to the ſhame of the Babylonians.</p>
                  <p>Though Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> expound it, <hi>ſatiatus es probro non tuo ſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieno.</hi> That the Babylonian did even ſatisfie himſelf with the diſgrace done to his enemy. Rather I take it for a puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the Babylonian, that ſhame ſhould come to him for this ſport that he made himſelfe, as it alſo followeth. <hi>Drink thou alſo, and let thy fore-skin be diſcovered: The Cup of the Lords right hand ſhall be turned unto thee, and ſhameful ſpewing ſhall be on thy glory.</hi>

                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:104898:164"/>This I take, it was not only figuratively revenged upon <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> when the glory of his Conqueſts ended in the ſhame of his transformation, the moſt wonderful example that we do read in all the book of God;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſame houre was the thing fulfilled upon</hi> Nebuchadnezzar,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.33.</note> 
                     <hi>and he was driven from men, and did eat graſſe as oxen, and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like Eagles feathers, and his nails like birds claws.</hi> For thus did the King continue in this ſhameful puniſhment the whole terme of ſeven years:</p>
                  <p>But literally this was fulfilled in <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> who made a great feaſt to a thouſand of his lords,<note place="margin">Dan. 5.1.</note> and drank wine before the thouſand;</p>
                  <p>In which drunken feaſt wherein the conſecrate veſſels of the Temple were abuſed in quaffing and carowſing, the fingers of an hand were ſeen on the wall over againſt the King, writing the doome of his ſhameful downfal. For obſerve the end;</p>

                     <hi>and</hi> Darius <hi>the Median took the Kingdome.</hi> So he did drink alſo, and his nakedneſſe was laid open, and the Medians came in and took away all their glory.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>For the violence of</hi> Lebanon <hi>ſhall cover thee, and the ſpoile of beaſts which made them afraid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This overthrow of the Chaldean Monarchy he calleth the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of <hi>Lebanon</hi> covering them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Junius</hi> doth underſtand this place thus, that the enemy ſhould come upon the Babylonian with the ſame violence that hunters uſe, who purſuing the wild beaſts in the forreſt of <hi>Lebanon</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pitched their nets and tents for them, do ſuddenly ſet upon them, and drive them into their nets: ſo ſudden a ſurprize ſhall the Babylonian ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> doth give this as a cauſe of their puniſhment, and underſtandeth the words thus, that God will cover the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian with ſhame for the violence that he offered to <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and to the beaſts therof forraging <hi>Judaea,</hi> and deſtroying not only men and women in towns, but the very wild beaſts of the forreſt of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> which was near to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> So that this expreſſeth the cauſe of Gods provocation againſt the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:104898:164"/>and withal the comfort of the Church, that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the wrong done to their land, not only to the People thereof, but to the very wild Beaſts of the forreſt.</p>

                  <p>Drunkenneſſe is confeſt of all men to be a ſinne; and they that love it beſt, and uſe it moſt, will be very angry with you, if you call them drunkards.</p>
                  <p>For it is not agreed upon as yet what drunkenneſſe is: our ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute law doth impoſe a penalty of five ſhillings upon every one that is convicted of drunkenneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Our Articles given to ſworn men, do charge them to enquire, if there be any Drunkards in our Pariſhes, and to preſent them.</p>
                  <p>But neither the Eccleſiaſtical Canon, nor the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth direct the inquiſition, by deſcribing what Perſons muſt be eſteemed drunk.</p>
                  <p>I will tell you whom the Scripture denoteth.</p>

                  <p>A King that drinketh wine is deſcribed then to be drunk, when they drink and forget the law,<note place="margin">Prov. 31.5</note> and pervert the judgment of the afflicted.

                  <p>O the miſerable ſtate of man in whom ſin reigneth, he is not only tempted to do evil, horrible and ſhameful evil, to drink drunk, but to be his neighbours devil to draw him into evill by making him drunk, and alſo this <hi>propter malum,</hi> even to diſcover the nakedneſſe of his brother.</p>
                  <p>Some ſhew themſelves in their pots like lyons furious and quarrelſome: others are dull and heavy, only ſerving for whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones to ſharpen the wits of the company: others drowſie and ſleepy: others talkative, every man in his humour, all in their nakedneſſe. To do evil that good may come of it, is an heinous ſin, for God needs not Satans help. But to do evil our ſelves to draw others into evil for ſo evil an end, this doth make ſin out of meaſure ſinful.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take nakedneſſe literally, for the diſcovering of thoſe parts which modeſty doth hide out of ſight: ſo after the tranſgreſſion the man and woman ſaw that they were naked, and they were aſhamed, being but themſelves alone in the garden, and they ſowed fig-leavs together to hide their nakedneſſe from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſight; ſo much remained in them, that having left <hi>primas ſapientiae,</hi> they yet retained <hi>ſecundas modeſtiae,</hi> and could not for ſhame behold each others nakedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Theſe members of the body which we think to be leſſe honourable,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.23.</note> 
                     <hi>upon theſe we beſtow more abundant honour, and our uncomely parts have more abundant comelineſſe.</hi> The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour here meant is the decent hiding of their nakedneſſe, and the modeſt covering of our ſhame.</p>
                  <p>Where the Apoſtle doth declare the care that is in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body; the comely parts which need no hiding from ſight do cover the uncomely parts from ſight.</p>
                  <p>Therefore they that uncover nakedneſſe do ſhew themſelves to be no members of the body: ſo that ſuch drunkards as give ſtrong drink to their neighhour, to this end to diſcover their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, declare themſelves to be no parts of the body of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:104898:169"/>Surely much nakedneſſe is diſcovered in many drunken meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and no marvel when men and women, having laid aſide reaſon and temperance, religion and the fear of God, if they then turn beaſts, and do thoſe things that are uncomely.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take this nakedneſſe in a ſpiritual ſenſe, then St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> will tell you, <hi>Lib. de Noe &amp; Arca c.</hi> 30. <hi>Omnis impius quoniam ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedevius diſciplinae eſt, aliorum lapſus pro ſui erroris ſolatio accipit, quod conſortes invenerit culpae.</hi>

                  <p>Then is the ſeaſon for the Coſener to invade the purſe of his neighbour, for the cunning inſidiator to take advantage of words to find out the infirmitits of his brother, that he may keep him in aw thereby. I cannot dive ſo deep into this myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity as to declare all; and again, I fear to go farre in it, leaſt I might teach the ignorant ſinner more cunning then he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>This I dare ſay that it is not love that maintaineth drunken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; for true love is a coverer of nakedneſſe: if literal, you may ſee it in <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Japhet:</hi> if ſpiritual, you may hear it from the Apoſtle, <hi>love covereth a multitude of ſins.</hi> And out of that love, <hi>David</hi> weeps fot them that keep not the law.</p>
                  <p>It becomes them beſt in my text, who know not God, but were abominable, and to every good work rebrobate, to make men drunk to make them ſport; but theſe things muſt not be ſo much as named amongſt thoſe that call God our father, that come to Church, that hear the word, that offer themſelves to be gueſts at the Lords boord.</p>

                  <p>God hath a juſt hand in the moderation of the things of this world, and of mens perſons.</p>
                  <p>Hath not the Sunne ſhined on thoſe that have made ſport to behold men drunk, or otherwiſe, have made the moſt of it to their ſhame and diſgrace amongſt men; who in the juſt puniſhment of their uncharitableneſſe, have themſelves fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame ſin of drunkenneſſe, and thereby have borne a ſhame and ſcandal to their profeſſion: this is Gods juſtice upon them, they did not conſider themſelves, they knew not the ſtrength of the temptation, they knew not their own weakneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt Profeſſors of Religion are commonly the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt judges of their brethren; for their zeale againſt ſin, and for the glory of God doth fill them with hatred of evill.</p>

                  <p>For, let all men know that the evill Angels are as much at Gods commandment as the good, for <hi>omnia illi ſerviunt,</hi> all things ſerve him: and as it is ſaid,</p>

                  <p>So God ſendeth evill Angels alſo, not only to <hi>Saul</hi> and to the falſe Prophets of <hi>Ahab,</hi> but even to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe God ſent him, and to St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Angel of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Theſe evill Angels ſometimes come with ſuggeſtions to ſin, to try our ſtrength, that we may know how weak we are; and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

                  <p>But for the ungodly of the earth, they emplunge them in the ſame ſin that they do cauſe others to commit, that the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and ſhame which they have done to their neighbour, may reflect upon themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Some have been ſo afraid of making God the author of evill, becauſe it is ſaid <hi>Tradidit eos Deus,</hi> God hath delivered them up, that they have underſtood the Apoſtle to ſpeak of that God who is called <hi>deus ſaeculi hujus,</hi> the god of this world; as the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees ſaw ſo much evill done, and knew not how to free God from guiltineſſe of it, they therefore made <hi>duo principia,</hi> two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings. But that needs not.</p>
                  <p>It is likely that ſuch a Father as is perſonated in the parable of the Prodigal, could not but obſerve in the education of his ſon, how thrifty he was like to prove; yet ſuch a father giving the portion of his goods which is a childs part, to ſuch a ſon, and letting him take his journey into a far country, is not acceſſary to his riotous living.</p>

                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that the heart of man is harned by God, <hi>Non impartiendo malitiam, ſed non largiendo gratiam,</hi> not by inſtilling any malice, but not giving grace.</p>
                  <p>He ſeeth the Chaldeans take delight in making men drunk; <hi>ut nuditatem videant;</hi> he letteth go the hold he hath of them for a time, and leaveth them to themſelves; and that which was their ſport, is now their fault and their ſhame.</p>
                  <p>I ſay therefore againe, conſider your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>When thou ſeeſt a drunkard ſhaming himſelf, as theſe here did, conſider whoſe light ſhineth in thy underſtanding, to ſhew thee how foul a ſinne that is; conſider that that is not enough; for all drunkards know that drunkenneſſe is a ſin; conſider whoſe grace it is that eſtabliſheth thy heart, and keepeth thee from committing the ſame ſin.</p>
                  <p>Inſult not over thy brother, deride him not, diſcover him not to increaſe his ſhame; rejoyce not againſt him, rather bewaile his ſin with the tears of thy ſoul, ſeek by the ſpirit of meekneſſe to reſtore him, adviſe him friendly, chide him lovingly.</p>
                  <p>For if thou who profeſſeſt a ſevere life, and to make conſcience
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:104898:174"/>of thy wayes, ſhouldeſt fall into this ſin thy ſelfe, thou wouldeſt not only ſhame thy perſon, but thy profeſſion alſo.</p>
                  <p>And indeed thou carrieſt about thee <hi>corpus peccati,</hi> a body of ſin; thou haſt the matter and ſtuffe of all ſins within thee, if grace do not aide and aſſiſt thee.</p>

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:104898:175"/>ſcamnum faceretne Priapum, maluit eſſe Deum.</hi> It was at his curteſie whether it ſhould be an Idol or ſome other thing.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. God ſaith, <hi>Woe unto him that ſaith to the wood awake, and to the dumb ſtone ariſe;</hi> that is, woe to him that truſteth to an Idol for defence againſt evill, or deliverance out of danger; for that is one of the uſes that is made of Idols to ſuccour in time of diſtreſſe, as the Diſciples did awake their Maſter in a ſtorme.</p>
                  <p>You ſee that when the workman hath put his hand upon it, and ſhewed his beſt skill, here God doth call it wood, and a dumb ſtone ſtill.</p>
                  <p>He proveth it thus. <hi>It ſhall teach,</hi> although it be dumb, yet the dumbneſſe thereof ſhall declare it to be an inanimate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent thing: For howſoever the matter of the Idol, be it wood or ſtone or metall, be laid over with gold and ſilver, as ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is coſtly enough in adorning their gods, yet <hi>there is no breath at all in the midſt of them,</hi> and having no life in them, they have no power to give help to them that ſerve them.</p>
                  <p>Verſ 20. <hi>But the Lord is in his holy temple;</hi> for having ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vanity of Idols, he cometh now to reveale himſelfe to them.</p>
                  <p>This ſome underſtand, that the Lord is in heaven, the temple of his holineſſe; and though the heaven of heavens cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him, yet he hath ſaid, <hi>Heaven is my throne;</hi> and Chriſt teacheth us to ſay, <hi>qui es in caeli,</hi> who art in heaven.</p>
                  <p>So the temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he ſaid, <hi>I will dwell,</hi> is the temple of his holineſſe; and as the Babylonians and other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then had their Idols and their Temples for them to which they did reſort; ſo he produceth in oppoſition to them the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his holy Temple, to whom the Jewes may reſort for help againſt all their enemies.</p>

                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:104898:177"/>But this kind of idolatry is ſo extinguiſhed by the light of the Goſpel, and ſo little cauſe of fear of it, that I need beſtow no time nor pains on it; for there is none of us, who doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe' one God in three Perſons.</p>
                  <p>But there is an idolatry amongſt thoſe that call themſelves Chriſtians, and would have none be the Church of God but themſelves, that is the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and though they proteſt againſt it, and plead not guilty to our accuſation, yet the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of truth will convince them of it.</p>
                  <p>Under the name of idol, Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth underſtand only <hi>falſam ſimilitudinem repreſentantem id quod revera non eſt,</hi> a falſe ſimilitude repreſenting that which indeed is not, as the dols.

                  <p>Theirs are <hi>imagines: imago ab imitando,</hi> of imitating, and they be Counterfeits, repreſenting in ſimilitude ſuch Perſons as have been, and have lived in the world.</p>
                  <p>So idols they defie, images they embrace. In this very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their defence, both abſurd in the ſtrife of words, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king diſtinction where there is no difference, for <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>ons, as that an image is the repreſentation of any thing, but an idol is commonly taken with us for the repreſentation of ſome thing that is worſhipped.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the beſt part of the Papiſts defence of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion againſt our imputation of idolatry, is this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That for the images that they do retain, either in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oratories, or in their private uſe, they know them in their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be no other then the creatures of God, of wood, ſtone, mettal, or ſome other mixt matter; they know them to be in their formes the art of the workman; they do know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe them to be dead, inanimate, ſenſeleſſe things in themſelves, and they proteſt againſt any adoration of them as much (they ſay) as we do. Here Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaks for the reſt, and he will charge the Proteſtant Church with ſlander in this point
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:104898:177"/>and ſay there is no ſuch matter, they do not worſhip any idols.</p>
                  <p>He complaineth, that by this ſlander, ſome of the Proteſtants have ſo diſtaſted the Religion of <hi>Rome</hi> to many that knows it not, that though they do hear of worthy men amongſt them, who for gravity of manners, holineſſe of life, and all exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary vertues deſerve reverence and reſpect, yet our opinion of their idolatry diſtaſteth them ſo to us, that we will not heare them ſpeak.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They anſwer, that their images are of two ſorts which they uſe in divine worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Either they be of God, or of the creature.</p>
                  <p>In the images which repreſent God, they only do worſhip God in the Image, not the Image it ſelf with Holy-worſhip.</p>
                  <p>In the images of the Creatures, as of the mother of the Lord, Angels and Saints, they do but honour God in his Saints; and in their invocation they uſe them but as means of quickning their memories, and turning up their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions by that which the eye beholdeth: and God loſeth no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by it to have ſo many means uſed to him.</p>
                  <p>This is that which they give out for themſelves, we charge them that they adore creatures, and give divine Worſhip to Images, s the heathen did.</p>
                  <p>For it is plain that they worſhip the wood of the Croſſe, in that they ſpeak that to the Crucifix, which can only be applyed to the Croſſe it ſelf and not to Chriſt, <hi>Salve crux ſpes unica.</hi> They adde, thou only wert worthy to bear the ranſome of the world O faithful Croſſe. Which agreeth with their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</p>
                  <p>That all the honour due to the Samplar is given to the image thereof.</p>
                  <p>And where they excuſe their idolatry, that they do not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the image, but God repreſented in the image: if that be not idolatry, neither were the Athenians Idolaters, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in their images the ſame God whom <hi>Paul</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.<note place="margin">Act. 17.23.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither were the Iſraelites idolaters, who worſhipped the true God in the Calfe which <hi>Aaron</hi> made; for they could not
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:104898:178"/>be ſo ignorant as to aſcribe their deliverance from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to ſuch a thing as <hi>Aaron</hi> could make.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine and practice of idolatry in the worſhip of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges came in by little and little into the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for it is clear that there was a time wherein there were no images at all known in the Church.</p>
                  <p>There were ſome deſirous then to bring them in, but the councel of <hi>Eliberis</hi> decreed that no picture or image ſhould be brought into the Church leſt it ſhould be adored.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Epiphanius</hi> finding an image painted on a cloth,<note place="margin">Can. 36.</note> hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Church, rent it down, and ſaid it was againſt the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scriptures that any image ſhould be in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith of his time,<note place="margin">Con. Celſ. l. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>nos imagines non adoramus,</hi> we do not worſhip images. Eight hundred years after Chriſt the ſecond Nicene Councel ſet up images; but</p>
                  <p>The Councel of <hi>Franckford,</hi> which was a general Councel, and where the Popes Legates were preſent, repealed it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,</p>
                  <p>The Catholick Church doth affirme, that mortal man ought to worſhip God, not by images and Angels, but by Chriſt our Lord.</p>
                  <p>And whatſoever the practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now is in the uſe of them, they ſhall never be able to reconcile the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their beſt learned concerning them. For</p>
                  <p>Some condemn all divine adoration given to them ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn external bowing before them, ſome confeſſe that the ancient fathers condemned them, ſome think their uſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                  <p>And they which have gone fartheſt in defending them, have done it by ſo nice diſtinctions, that the common People cannot underſtand how to beware of idolatry, themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding themſelves therein.</p>
                  <p>Even in the adminiſtration of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, they are idolaters in worſhipping the hoaſt; which I prove from Cardinal <hi>Bellarmines</hi> own penne <hi>De juſtif. lib.</hi> 3, <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <q>Ne que poteſt certus eſſe certitudine fidei, ſe percipere verum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum, cum Sacramentum ſine intentione miniſtri non confici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur,

                  <p>And thus much <hi>Garnet</hi> the Provincial did ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe upon his private conference with ſome of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore how they can excuſe their idolatry in the worſhip of the elevated hoaſt, I cannot ſee, ſeeing they worſhip they know not what.</p>
                  <p>Any man may eaſily conceive that they do carry a corrupt mind that way, becauſe in all their Catechiſmes ſet forth for the inſtitution of young beginners, they do leave out the ſecond Commandment quite, and to make up the number they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the tenth Commandment into two.</p>
                  <p>Now having convinced them of idolatry which is the high ſin againſt God, and toucheth him in his Majeſty and Glory, we ſee how dangerous a thing it is to have converſation with ſuch, leaſt we receive of the plagues due to them.</p>
                  <p>Though the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> did hold faſt the name of Chriſt, and denied not his faith, yet had the Lord ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her;<note place="margin">Rev. 2.14.</note> Becauſe ſhe had there them that held the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who taught <hi>Balak</hi> to caſt a ſtumbling block before the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to eat things ſacrificed unto idols, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit fornication.</p>

                  <p>But ſome of our Sectaries ſay, there is no need of Churches for Gods publick ſervice; there is neither precept nor example in Scripture for it, but the words of Chriſt to the woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> leave it at large.</p>

                  <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calleth this hereſie in the Maſſilians, that they denied the uſe of Temples, becauſe Chriſt foretold that the uſe of the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould ceaſe, which was a ſhadow of things to come.</p>
                  <p>In the Old Teſtament beſide the Cathedral, and Mother-Church, the People had their Synagogues for their meetings to Gods ſervice, which continued even to and in Chriſts time. Chriſt himſelf deſigned a place for that meeting, wherin he celebrated the laſt Paſſeover, and inſtituted the Sacrament of his Supper.</p>
                  <p>The Diſciples had a place of meeting wherein Chriſt twice found them the firſt day of the week.</p>
                  <p>The perſecutions of thoſe times gave no ſodain liberty to ſettle a Church, and to erect Temples, nor that I can read, for the firſt 200 years after Chriſt were any Temples built.</p>
                  <p>Yet before the perſecutions ceaſed, they had erected Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for their meeting to Prayer and hearing of the Word; for

                  <p>And ever ſince the Church hath continued this practiſe of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taing Oratories for the meeting of the Congregations for the praiſe and ſervice of God.</p>
                  <p>There is warrant enough from the example of the Church, and the Authority thereof to maintain this holy practice.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe places be the Temples of Gods holineſſe, the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God ſeparate from all common uſe to the holy ſervice of God.</p>
                  <p>And God who by his Omnipotency filleth all places, is in our Churches by a more ſpecial preſence; for if the Glory of God filled the Temple in the time of the Law, why may we not believe that in the light of the Goſpel, he reveileth his Preſence more, becauſe the place wherein we ſerve God is Gods houſe, and all Civil and common uſe of it is reſigned, to conſecrate it to Gods ſervice.</p>
                  <p>If God be preſent where two or three are aſſembled, ſurely where there is a meeting of a full Congregation he is preſent with a ſpecial preſence.</p>

                  <p>Theſe houſes of God are the temples of his holineſſe where the name of God is declared to the Church, wherein God by his
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:104898:181"/>Spirit ſpeaketh to the Churches in the outward miniſtry of the word; where the holy ones of God do ſpeak to God by the ſame Spirit in prayers, in hymnes, and ſpiritual ſongs, where the ſacrifices of righteouſneſſe are offered.</p>
                  <p>And herein is that gracious Prophecy of <hi>Iſay</hi> fulfilled which our Saviour alleadgeth in the Goſpel,</p>

                     <hi>For mine houſe ſhall be called a houſe of prayer for all people,</hi>

                  <p>This cannot be made good in the temple of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> nor in any one Church, but muſt determine both the extent and dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods worſhip, and the deſignation of fit houſes for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Another like Prophecy we have before in <hi>Iſay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>And many people ſhall go and ſay, come ye and let us go up to the top of the mountain of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Sion ſhall go forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord from</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</p>
                  <p>The common expoſition is that after the returne of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the 70 years captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> then Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Gods Worſhip ſhall be ſetled at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>

                  <p>For further proof hereof read <hi>Micha</hi> 4. where you ſhall find this Prophecy <hi>totidem verbis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 1.2.</note> in ſo many words, and a commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon it, <hi>Micah</hi> 5. wherein he prophecyeth the birth of Chriſt in Bethlehem.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:104898:181"/>In both theſe Prophecies we obſerve, that the promiſe of God hath not only aſſured the ſpreading of true Religion, but the aſſemblies of beleivers to certain places for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they may bee taught <hi>vias Domini,</hi> the ways of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Never was there Religion in the world, without ſome places of publick-Worſhip, for meeting of people together: Even in <hi>Adams</hi> time, there was a place where <hi>Adam</hi> and his children met to offer ſacrifice, and <hi>Cains</hi> flying from the preſence of the Lord, was his wilfull excommunication from that place.</p>
                  <p>And in truth they that would have no Churches, may aſwell cry down Religion, and the publique miniſtry of the Word, and pluck down the hedge which God hath planted about his Vine, and lay all common.</p>
                  <p>Underſtand us rightly; we do not affix holineſſe to the place, nor think any ſpeciall ſanctity inherent in it; but ſeeing God is by a ſingular right become maſter of the houſe, that is ſeparate to his uſe, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>judge I pray you, is it comely, that wee put not difference between Gods Houſe and our owne houſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is obſerved that Chriſt when he purged the temple, purged only that part of the temple which was ſet apart to prayer, and hearing of the Word, becauſe that uſe of the Church was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the time of the Goſpel: and after he had caſt out the oxen and the doves, which were proviſions for ſacrifice, then he citeth that place and reneweth the ſanction,</p>

                     <hi>My houſe ſhall be called an houſe of prayer to all nations, which is a ſanctification of all Churches to the Worſhip of God.</hi> That this was ſo underſtood,</p>
                  <p>Know that before they had any Churches built for the publick exerciſe of Religion, they had ſome places of meeting which they called <hi>Aedes ſacras,</hi> holy houſes; of which the Apoſtle put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting difference, ſayth, <hi>have ye not houſes to eat and drink in?</hi>

                  <p>The Temple is a type of Heaven, where the Saints of God do meet to praiſe God, which is the worſhip that is done to God in heaven;</p>

                  <p>This Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> underſtandeth of the Church of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, where God is ſeen.</p>

                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:104898:182"/>So doth <hi>James Brocard</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> underſtand it of the Church delivered from Poperie, and Mahometry, and all haereſie.</p>
                  <p>But Maſter <hi>Bullinger</hi> better adviſed, ſaith, that as in the former part of this Revelation hell is deſcribed; ſo in this <hi>chapter</hi> heaven is ſet forth;</p>
                  <p>And that as you ſee in the ſimilitude of a tabernacle, ſo doth <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Napier</hi> well interpret this place.</p>
                  <p>I conclude then that all the Churches wherein the Chriſtians meet to call upon God, are the temples of Gods preſence, wherein God is inviſibly reſident both to give his Spirit where he thinketh good, and to direct our ſervice of him, and to receive our prayers and ſacrifices of thankſgiving: and to communicate to his ſervants the ordinances of his grace, the means of their ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As God is in theſe temples made with hands, and declareth his preſence in his houſe, in his Word and Sacraments, and in the ſolemne meetings of his children; ſo is he in heaven which is his higheſt temple, whereof theſe are but types and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>
                  <p>We beleive in him as maker of heaven, and we pray to him our father which art in heaven; this place he himſelf calleth his habitation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I dwell in the high and holy place.</hi> 1. In heaven.</p>
                  <p>Yet as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The heaven of heavens is not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 57.15 2 Reg. 8.27.</note> So he is there as in the moſt excellent part of his creation, but not comprehended there; for there he is moſt purely worſhipped; thence cometh our <hi>Sicut in Coelo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The heathen gods are no where in heaven they are not, that is the temple of the true God; in earth they are not; for they are no gods that have reſidence in earth, and have no power at all in heaven,</p>
                  <p>As the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.4</note> 
                     <hi>We know that an Idol is nothing in the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here by the name of Idol is not meant, the material image repreſenting their god: for that is a bodily ſubſtance to be ſeen and felt, and it is in the world: but he ſpeaketh it <hi>de nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:104898:183"/>the divinity is a <hi>non ens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For he addeth that there is no God but one; and whereas many be called gods in heaven and in earth, as there be many gods and many Lords; yet he ſaith there is but one God, the reſt are <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina,</hi> not <hi>numina.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For there were that worſhipped the, Sun the Moon and the ſtarres; theſe as creatures and ſecond cauſes do us good, but they ſerve our God.</p>
                  <p>When our God is in his Temple, all thoſe help to make up the quire of them that praiſe him; <hi>For the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmaments and the out goings of the morning praiſe him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore do we lift up our eyes to heaven when we pray, we ſay that every good and perfect gift comes from above, from the Father of lights.</p>
                  <p>Yet is not God ſo far off, but that as heaven is his throne, earth is his foot-ſtoole.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord looketh from heaven,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 33.13.</note> 
                     <hi>he beholdeth the ſonnes of men.</hi> He is not ſo far off but if we pray to him, <hi>Prope eſt invocantibus ipſum,</hi> he is neer to them that call upon him.</p>
                  <p>And in this reſpect all the earth is a common oratory, ſo is the ſea, for our prayers.</p>
                  <p>But as the perpetuall duty of a Religious ſervice of God, which doth require holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the days of our lives, doth not take away the particular duty of the Sabbath: neither doth the great hahitation of God in heaven abate any thing of his ſpecial preſence, both in the temples dedicated to his ſervice, and in every particular perſon which doth belong to the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace.</p>
                  <p>For ſo God ſaith, <hi>I dwell with him that is humble and contrite in heart:</hi> and he ſaith ſo preſently after he had ſaid, <hi>I will dwell in the high and holy place:</hi> in ſo much as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon thoſe words of <hi>David, exaudivit de templo ſancto ſuo vocem meam,</hi> ſaith</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe wordes are the title of this Chapter, ſhewing the contents thereof.</p>
                  <p>It is called a prayer, and it is a Pſalme or Hymne, ſuch as <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms; the Heathen Poets call them Odes, or Songs.</p>
                  <p>It is called the prayer or ſong of <hi>Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk,</hi> both as compoſed by him, uſed by himſelf; and addreſſed to the uſe of the people of God in their captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a ſong upon <hi>Sigionoth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hebrews</hi> affirm this ſong to be one of the hardeſt places to interpret in all the old Teſtament, becauſe it is full of dark Parables, ſuch as could not be well underſtood till he came, <hi>Who hath the key of</hi> David, <hi>who openeth and no man ſhutteth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:104898:187"/>Our former Tranſlation readeth a Prayer of <hi>Habakkuk</hi> the Prophet for the ignorances, and it is expounded diverſly.</p>
                  <p>Some underſtanding it a prayer to God for the pardon of all thoſe ſins which the people of God have committed igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly.</p>
                  <p>Others conceive thus, that ſeeing the Prophet in the behalf of the Church in the firſt Chapter had taxed God, of too much remiſneſs toward his people, in bearing with their ſins, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to puniſh them: and then again, fore-ſeeing how God in time would awake and puniſh them by the furious <hi>Chaldae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> hee doth as much tax the ſeverity of God towards his Church.</p>
                  <p>Now, that God in the ſecond Chapter hath declared his juſtice in puniſhing his people, and reveiled the decree of his vengeance againſt his and their enemies; now the Prophet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this recantation and prayer for the ignorances, becauſe they not knowing the ſecret purpoſes of God, have been ſo forward to judg his ways.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt admit this confirmation, and the learned tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators of the Kings Bible, finding this to have been an errour in the former tranſlations, have followed the Originall more faithfully, and call it, <hi>The Prayer of Habakkuk the Prophet upon Sigionoth.</hi> Some ſay, this <hi>Sigionoth</hi> was ſome ſpeciall inſtrument of Muſick, upon which this ſong was ſung in the Church of God, and the laſt verſe of this Chapter ſaith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the chief ſinger on my ſtringed inſtruments.</hi> For as <hi>Title<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſaith in this Pſal. the Prophet, <hi>Canendo orat, orando canit.</hi> By ſinging prayed, and by praying ſung.</p>
                  <p>So the 70 read <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Junius</hi> read, <hi>Oratio Habak. Prophetae ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum odas mixtas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is not accommodated to any ſet kind of verſe, but mixt of ſundry kinds.</p>
                  <p>And ſo they do not underſtand the word <hi>Sigionoth</hi> to be the the name of the inſtrument, upon which it was ſung: but the name of the verſe into which their prayer is digeſted.</p>

                     <hi>Heroick, Iambick, Aſclepediake, Phaluciake,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>I cannot better expreſſe this to the underſtanding of the weakeſt judgment, then by referring you to the varieties of verſe in our Engliſh Pſalmes, that we ſing in the Church, for if they were all compoſed in one kind of verſe, they might all be ſung to one tune.</p>
                  <p>Some have their ſet tunes and admit no other, becauſe they are of a ſeverall kind of verſe. So I take it that this <hi>Sigionoth</hi> was the name of that kind of verſe, in which this Pſalme was written.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the words of the title.</p>

                     </label> of the vengeance of God revenging the quarrels of his Church, and of the mercy of God in healing the wounds of his Church, and reſtoring it again to health; doth give the Faithfull occaſion to reſort to God by prayer.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe theſe things well conſidered that God is juſt and mercifull, do breed in us Fear and Faith, which being well mingled in us, cannot chuſe but break forth into prayer.</p>
                  <p>Fear diſcerning the danger of his power wiſely, and Faith laying hold on the hand of his mercy ſtrongly.</p>
                  <p>For howſoever Fear be an effect of weakneſſe, yet doth it ſerve to good uſe in the fitting of us to prayer; becauſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Fear breedeth humility, which is neceſſary in prayer, as St. <hi>James</hi> adreſſeth.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 Fear breedeth in us a deſire to approve our ſelves to God, and keepeth us in awe, ſetting both our ſins always in our own ſight, and our ſelves in the ſight of God, which ſheweth, what need we have to fly to him.</p>

                  <p>This alſo doth break forth into prayer, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>I believed, therefore did I ſpeake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fear directed by Faith, will ſoon finde the face of God.</p>
                  <p>For fear humbleth us, faith directeth this humiliation to the mighty hand of God.</p>

                  <p>Fear makes us runne, faith ſheweth us the face of God, and biddeth us runne thither; and thus the contemplation of Gods juſtice and mercy doth fill the heart with zeale, and the ſpirit of ſupplications, as in this preſent example.</p>
                  <p>The Church ſeeth God remiſſe in forbearing them, it feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God ſharp in puniſhing them, it diſcerneth him juſt in avenging them, and it is promiſed mercy and favour in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, therefore the Prophet teacheth them to pray.</p>

                  <list>
                     <item>1 That Poetry is ancient, and hath been of uſe in the Church of God, and in Gods ſervice and worſhip, for theſe were the Anthems of the Church in former times.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>The firſt point concerning the ancient, laudable, and holy uſe of Meeters, which we call Poetry, ſo continued through the whole courſe of the Bible, as you have heard, doth ſhew that God requireth of us in his worſhip, not only plain faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, ſoundly and ſincerely to expreſſe our ſelves in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: but he requireth alſo that we ſhew all our learning, wit, and art in our compoſitions, according to the ſtrict lawes of a Verſe: thoſe were the Ballads of former times.</p>
                  <p>And though vaine, obſcene, wanton, lying rithmes, now printed, do carry the name of Ballads wholly, yet holy ſongs have been ſo called, if you look in your old Church Bibles, that were firſt printed in Engliſh, you ſhall finde the Song of <hi>Solomon</hi> or the <hi>Canticles</hi> called <hi>Solomons</hi> Ballad, or the Ballad of Ballads. The reaſons why God deſired and delighted in this form of worſhip.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 Becauſe this gift of holy Poetry is of and from himſelf, he is the Authour of it, and the ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael</hi> learned it of him, to honour him in Hymnes, therefore the Apoſtle calleth them ſpirituall ſongs, that is inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt; &amp; it is juſt that thoſe ſpirituall graces, which derive their being from him, ſhould be conſecrated in their uſe to him. And this is cleer, that there is no poetry ſo ancient as the holy Hymns of the Church.</item>
                     <item>2 St <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his preface to the Pſalmes, ſaith. <hi>Spiritus ſanctus videns obluctantem ad virtutis viam humani ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris animam, &amp; ad delectationes hujus vitae inclinari delectabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus modulii Cantilenae vim ſuae doctrinae permiſcuit, ut dum ſva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate Carmine mulcetur auditus divini ſermonis pariter utilitas inſeratur.</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104898:191"/>thoſe of more yeares, who have at Church given no heed to the reading of the Prophets and Apoſtles, have been ſo taken with the delight of the Pſalmes, that they have learned to ſing them at home, and upon the way, which alſo brought forth good effects in them, by the power of that good Spirit which endited them; <hi>quia miſcuit utile dulci.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>St <hi>Augnſtiue</hi> reſembleth the wiſedome of God herein to the art of the Phyſitian, who gives his patient things whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but not very taſtfull in ſome ſweet ſirrups, or liquours, which may convey it without diſtaſt into the body.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 This expreſſure of the zeal of Gods glory in verſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the labour of the brain, the marrow of wit, the earneſt wreſtling of the ſoul ſtriving to glorifie God, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>With the beſt member, that we have, doth beſt preſent the inward man, the hid man of the heart,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> calleth it, <hi>to Almighty God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle biddeth us to <hi>affect the beſt gifts.</hi> They that do only read a Pſalme, or a Prayer in a book, have done little, but they that love the dead letter, an enlightened underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſanctified affections, they pray and praiſe God.</p>
                  <p>They that wiſely compoſe their own meditations, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſe their own hearts in their own words, holy hearts in holy words, do mount a degree higher.</p>
                  <p>But they that honour God with art and nature, obſerving the lawes of time, number, and meaſure; as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, they have <hi>Eruditam mentem,</hi> a learned mind, and they are come, <hi>ad provectam aetatem,</hi> to a ripe age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> excelled in this kinde, whoſe Nuptiall Hymne is called worthily <hi>Canticum Canticorum.</hi> It is a good obſervation of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> that the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which is <hi>Diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na morum,</hi> the diſcipline of manners, and <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> which is <hi>Diſciplina amorum,</hi> the diſcipline of loves, the one correcting our vain love of our ſelves, the other of the world, muſt go firſt, and then our underſtanding and affections will be fitted to make ſuch Verſes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 This kind of honouring God in Ditties and Hymnes, doth pleaſe God in the Church, becauſe even ſuch of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104898:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>Heathen, who had no other light but the light of nature, have yet in this kind honoured the unknown God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Lactantius</hi> writing to the Heathen to bring them to the knowledge of the true God, proveth the Divinity by the very teſtimonies of their Poets, who in Poeticall raptures have given teſtimony to this truth.</p>

                  <p>I need not follow <hi>Lactantius</hi> any further, having in him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken the point which I have delivered, that ſeeing God hath had honour from Poetry amongſt the heathen, much more in his Church let him be ſo honoured.</p>

                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:104898:192"/>Now ſince God had honour from heathen Poets, much more is he honoured within the Church, by thoſe raviſhed ſpirits, within a lofty ſtrain, ſound out his prayſes, or their own ſorrowes, and wants.</p>

                     <hi>O Lord, I have heard thy Speech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Word of God is vvell beſtovved on them that vvill hear it vvith reverence, and receive it vvith humility, here vvas a maze, the Prophet and the Faithfull of the land had loſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they knevv not vvhat to think, till they had put the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to God himſelf. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. and God having made a ful anſvver. novv the Prophet ſaith in his ovvn name, and in the name for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104898:198"/>whom he conſulted God, <hi>I have heard thy ſpeech.</hi> All the Scripture is full of examples, of the Children of God, hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his word of precepts, and admonitions to us to hearken: of promiſes to them that do hearken.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe it is a ſpeciall note of Gods children to heare his Word, even as our Saviour himſelf ſaith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that is of God, heareth Gods Word: ye therefore hear them not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 8.47.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe ye are not of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now ſeeing God hath given over ſpeaking by miracles extraordinarily to his Church. St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith: <hi>We are of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>he that knoweth God, heareth us, he that is not of God, heareth not us,</hi> hereby we know the Spirit of Truth, and the ſpirit of errour.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit of truth is left in the Church by our Saviour, and he ſpeaketh in ſuch; who by the Ordinance of Chriſt, are the Prieſts of the new Teſtament, of whom Chriſt ſaith. <hi>Qui vos recipit, me recipit: &amp; qui recipit me, recipit eum qui miſit me:</hi> he that receiveth you, receiveth me, and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me: we muſt hear him, before he hear us, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us true,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note> 
                     <hi>We know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought.</hi> The art of prayer, is not ſo quickly learned as ſome forward proofeſſours make themſelves believe. <hi>John</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his continuall preaching to his Diſciples, taught them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to pray.</p>
                  <p>And never had any Diſciples a better Maſter, then the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Jeſus Chriſt, yet they living in the eare of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and in the eye of his holy example, were glad to come to him to be taught to pray, &amp; he taught them the Lords prayer privately, which after he taught the whole multitude in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon openly.</p>
                  <p>My obſervation is that his Word muſt miniſter matter to our prayers,<label type="milestone">

                     </label> and all our petitions muſt be grounded thereupon.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe God heareth not ſinners,<note place="margin">John 9.31.</note> and <hi>David</hi> ſaith: <hi>If I regard wickedneſſe in my heart, the Lord will not hear me. But the prayer of a righteous man prevaileth much,</hi>

                  <p>Againſt ſin we have no ſuch remedy as the word. So <hi>David,

                  <p>Our Leſſons from hence are;</p>
                  <p n="1">1 We muſt take it for a great favour of God to us, that he giveth us his word, for that is a lanthorne to our feet, that is, our counſalor, as <hi>David</hi> calleth it.</p>
                  <p>This word is given us to profit withall, and it is depoſited.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 In the Books of the Canonical Scripture, which we have not, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhut up in an unknown language, but tranſlated faithfully into our own tongue, that all of us may be partakers of it.</item>
                     <item>2 As in the time of the law, the Prieſts lips did preſerve knowledge, and men were to require the law at their lips, ſo in the time of the Goſpel, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, of the Apoſtles, and of all the Miniſters, that ſhould ſucceed them in their office in the Church,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.19.</note> 
                        <hi>God hath committed to us the word of reconciliation,</hi> he hath ſo committed it to his Son firſt, as he gave him power to tranſmit it in the Prieſthood of the New Teſtament; to all ages of the Church till his ſecond coming.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The ſpirit which Chriſt left to comfort and inſtruct his Church, was not given at large to all men, but in perticular ordinance to them whom he ſent, to teach all Nations, as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Our ſufficiency is of God, who hath made us able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the New Teſtament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit; for the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So we are the Miniſters of the word that giveth life, and there is no life to be had but by our Miniſtry. This gives us intereſt in your affections, in your underſtandings, in your goods, in your prayers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Now we know where we may hear God, we are taught alſo not to neglect him ſpeaking to us, for as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.25.</note> 
                     <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh: for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Miniſters of the Goſpel do ſpeak even as if Chriſt himſelf ſpake in us,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.10.</note> we ſpeak in Chriſts ſtead.</p>
                  <p>But as in the time of the Law God ſent his Prophets ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104898:199"/>to ſuch as would not give them the hearing: ſo doth he now in the time of the Goſpel, but that muſt not diſcourage our Miniſtry, at their peril be it, Gods Word will ever be Gods wiſdom, though the prophane count it fooliſhneſs, and it will be Gods truth though hereſie and ſchiſme pick quarrels.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, if you would learn to pray, and be prepared for that holy worſhip? hear Gods ſpeech firſt, and that will teach you what to ask as you ou ought. Hear the word from us as the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> did.<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.13.</note> 
                     <hi>When ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth the Word of God, which effectually worketh alſo in you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>

                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Who can come without fear before him, that can and will do all this? for if he be angry, yea but a little, they are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that truſt in him, fear is a proper paſſion of a true believer, and is inſeparably joyned with ſaving faith.</p>
                  <p>For ſeeing the bond of our union with Chriſt by faith, whereby he dwelleth in us is.</p>
                  <p>Partly, the hold that he hath of us by his Spirit:</p>

                  <p>From hence it comes, that all the intelligence between God and man doth begin at fear in us.</p>
                  <p>This is not the fear of an evill conſcience, as it was in <hi>Adam,</hi> when he hid himſelf from God, but the fear of reverence of God, and the good conſcience of our unworthineſſe being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from our originall righteouſneſſe.</p>

                  <p>This is the ſeaſoning and preparing of the heart for God to be caſt down before him, it is humbling our ſelves under the mighty hand of God, and we cannot pray as we ought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>

                  <p>And herein God is moſt gratious, for when our ſins come in our ſight, and we are horribly afraid of Gods judgments, even then God ſendeth his Spirit to us, not to take away our infirmities quite, but to help them, not to turne our ſorrow into joy, but to ſanctifie our ſorrow, and to ſupply it with ſighs and groanes, and this addition of fear and grief doth alſo mend devotion.</p>
                  <p>To ſuch we muſt ſay, that though he to whom we pray be in Heaven, yet he is our Father, and though great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous be his Majeſty, yet he is the preſerver of men.</p>

                  <p n="4">4 Sometimes we do feel ſuch want of the Spirit of God in us, that Satan takes advantage thereat, perſwadeth that God hath forſaken us: and thus many of Gods deare children feel the bitterneſſe of deſpaire for a time, in which agony, <hi>Job</hi> cries,</p>

                  <p>St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> turnes all into Allegory, and applieth it to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>You remember, how before, I found that the Church doth comfort their preſent miſeries, with remembrance of Gods former mercies, therefore I chooſe to keep pace with the ſtory of Gods former mercies to his <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And as before he ſpake of the comming of God from <hi>Teman</hi> and <hi>Paran,</hi> when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared glorious to them in giving the law, ſo now he comes to another powerfull mercy, that is, when he gave them the promiſed Land, for then he that went before them all the vvay of their journey in their removes, now ſtood ſtill, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that novv they vvere come to the land of their reſt, as he had promiſed it.</p>
                  <p>And there, <hi>He meaſured the Earth,</hi> it is aſcribed here to God, that he divided the land amongſt the Tribes, becauſe it vvas done by lot, vvherein not chance, but God anſwered.</p>
                  <p>This hath reference to that ſtory vvhich vve read <hi>Joſhua</hi> 5. for when the people vvere entred into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and vvere come ſo far in to it as <hi>Gilgall,</hi> that the Ark of God was ſetled in <hi>Gilgall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then God commanded the Sacrament of Circumciſion to be revived, vvhich in the vvhole journey between their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of Aegypt to this place had been omitted, ſo long vvas it omitted, becauſe of the journey that there entred into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but two of all that came out of Aegypt, who had received the Sacrament of Circumciſion, vvho vvere <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Novv all the males are circumciſed at <hi>Gilgall,</hi> there the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> kept the Paſſeover, and there they began to eat of the old proviſion of corn, that they found in the land, and as ſoon as they had eaten thereof, <hi>Manna</hi> ceaſed, and there, <hi>Verſe</hi> 13.</p>

                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:104898:218"/>There ſtood a man over againſt him, with his ſword drawn in his hand, to whom <hi>Joſhua</hi> went, and ſaid unto him. <hi>Art thou for us, or for our adverſaries?</hi> he ſaid, <hi>nay; but as a Prince of the hoaſt of the Lord, am I now come, and Joſhua fell on his face, and did worſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Compare that ſtorie with this text, and you ſhall ſee that this man that ſtood before <hi>Joſhua,</hi> is he that ſtood in my text, and after meaſured the earth: and ſo <hi>Joſhua</hi> conceived him to be, elſe he had not worſhipped him, for <hi>Joſhuah</hi> was not to learn that Angels are not to be worſhipped.</p>
                  <p>So this place will not help the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for the maintenance of the worſhip of Angels, though <hi>Lyranus</hi> ſay, that it was <hi>adoratio duliae, quia cognovit eum eſſe Angelum.</hi> The man that ſtood there was that Son of man, that Prince of the Lords Armies, which brought <hi>Iſrael out of the Land of Aegypt, out of the houſe of bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he ſtood there, for there was the Ark ſetled, and the Sacrament revived, and they were at home when they began to feed upon the proviſion of the promiſed Land: and next it followeth, that <hi>He meaſured the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For in the next Chap. <hi>Jericho</hi> was taken; <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>Ai</hi> is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; and ſhortly after the land is meaſured, and by lott aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the Tribes.

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe titles and attributes of Everlaſting and Perpetuall, are in true propriety of ſenſe onely belonging to God, but this is a poeticall and figurative hymne, and by an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> theſe words do ſignifie the mighty power of God, who ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe unconquered mountains, fixt and ſetled in their places, to the obedience of his people, and brought the ſtrenght of the land into their ſubjection.</p>
                  <p>Declaring that by no ſtrength of their own, they got the quiet poſſeſſion of that land, but they received it of the gift of God, who ſubdued the impregnable ſtrength to their hand, and gave them victory, for it followeth;</p>

                  <p>There was an old curſe which lay in the deck, and ſlept all this while, ever ſince <hi>Cham</hi> the youngeſt, the ſon of <hi>Noah,</hi> diſcovered his fathers nakedneſs, for then <hi>Noah</hi> awoke and knew what his ſons had done to him, and he ſaid, <hi>Curſed be Canaan,</hi> that is, Let a curſe fall upon the poſterity of <hi>Cham:</hi> theſe be the ways of God, for the iſſue of <hi>Shem</hi> drove out <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans</hi> ſeed and poſſeſſed their Land.</p>

                  <p>His driving out of the Nations to make them room, his ſcattering of the mountains and bowing of the hils, all this was not done that <hi>Iſrael</hi> might hold the land of promiſe no longer: for the promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and St. <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Ma. 1.17.</note> that from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>David</hi> are 14 generations: and from <hi>David</hi> to the deportation into <hi>Babylon</hi> 14 generations; there were from the promiſe of this land to the captivity but 28 generations: and the firſt 14 generations from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>David</hi> were wel ſpent, before the land was poſſeſt; and ſo much God foretold <hi>Abraham,</hi> and foure hundred years delay, and expectation of the promiſe we have hereof from the mouth of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi>

                  <p>Then the Landlord complained he could not have his rent: the Tenant that he could not pay it, plenty had undone him.</p>
                  <p>Such is the unconſcionable rack of rents, generally through the Common-wealth, that plenty is a puniſhment to many, even a ſharpe and ſmarting rod. And doth not God begin to viſit our land with ſudden dearth, how much of the hope of the earth doth now lye in ſteep in the drowned earth, never likely to pay the ſeed that the earth borrowed.</p>
                  <p>It is time for the Lord to pull thy hand out of thy boſome,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104898:222"/>and to whet thy ſword, when thy mercies become burthens to the ſons of men.</p>

                  <p>Did ever age ſow precedents ſo thick for poſterity, of droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, declining and falling greatneſs.

                  <p>Unlawful and indirect means of bettring our eſtates, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of our conſciences, do break our bags, and ſpring leaks in our Ships, that we and our good periſh, but the fear of the Lord maketh us rich; and what wanteth in the peace of the world, is ſupplied in the peace of a good conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doct.</hi> Figurative ſpeeches are in uſe in holy Scripture: this Text is full of them, ſo is this whole Pſalm.</p>
                  <p>I will onely note theſe figures, which in this verſe do offer themſelves to us, for a taſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:104898:222"/>1 It is here ſaid that God ſtood.</p>
                  <p>This is ſpoken after the maner of men, for when hearing and ſeeing, and ſmelling, and touching, and taſting, which are our ſenſes are attributed to God: when our parts of body, our eyes, ears, mouth, hands, feet, armes are given to him: our motions: as ſetting, ſtanding, riſing, going, ſtriking and ſuch like are ſpoken of God, know that theſe be figurative forms of ſpeech, wherein the holy Ghoſt doth retein our weak capacities, and under thoſe forms of words, doth preſent to our underſtandings the unconceiveable operations of the moſt high God.</p>
                  <p>And let us take heed that we do not conceive God in our thoughts like to man in the ſtructure and compoſition of the body as the <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>For it is here underſtood by the ſtanding of God, that when he brought the people to the promiſed land, there the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe ended, he ſtood there where he brought them to reſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is here ſaid, that he meaſured the earth, that is, alſo a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative manner of ſpeaking, wherein that is charged upon him, which was done by his direction and warrant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>He beheld and drove in ſunder the Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is all eye, and beholdeth all things, all ear, and heareth all things; all hand, and maketh all things, and doth whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he wil: all foot and ſtandeth in all places: he is here ſaid to behold, which denoteth his provident care of his work, and he is ſaid to drive in ſunder the Nations, becauſe he ordein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their expulſion, and he gave commiſſion for the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, that he might give their land, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to his own people.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Where he cals the mountains everlaſting and the hils perpetuall, this is alſo a figure. For theſe be attributes onely belonging to God to be everlaſting and perpetuall, and it ſheweth the ſtability and ſetledneſſe thereof.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 There is alſo another figure in the very name of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, for we muſt not literally underſtand that there was any violence offered to the mountains and hils, but thereby the ſtrength and proceſſe and ſetled eſtate of thoſe nations that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104898:223"/>dwelt in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> is ſignified, and ſo the ſcattering and bowing of theſe moutains, doth expreſſe the diſperſion of thoſe nations, or the bringing of them under the yoake of ſubjection to the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6 His wayes are everlaſting, this is alſo figurative, for by the ways of God are underſtood here the counſels and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God, and his executions of his will, which are no ſudden operations, but proceed from everlaſting wiſedome.</p>
                  <p>And this is the wiſedome of the Reader of holy Scripture, to obſerve, what is ſpoken literally, and what figuratively, elſe many errours and hereſies may ariſe.</p>
                  <p>As even in this attribution of the parts and motions, and actions of the body of man to God, the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> not underſtanding the figure, did conceive God in body like to man.</p>
                  <p>The hereſie of tranſubſtantiation grew out of the miſtake of thoſe words, <hi>hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> this is my body, wherein the figure not obſerved, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do believe a reall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of the bread into the body of Chriſt: whereas that is to be underſtood only by ſacramentall repreſentation, as as the ſacrament of Circumciſion is called the covenant of God in the fleſh, and the water of Baptiſme, is called the laver of regeneration, being the ſign and ſeal thereof.</p>
                  <p>You know that when Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples; <hi>Beware of the leaven of the Phariſes:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 16.16</note> they underſtood him not to ſpeak figuratively, and ſaid; <hi>It is becauſe we have taken no bread.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So when he ſaid, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple:</hi> the Jews underſtood him of the temple at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The Scriptures of both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are full of examples of figurative ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>The whole book of the ſong of <hi>Solomon,</hi> is a continued figure, and all the poeticall part of holy Scripture abound therewith.</p>

                  <p>St. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, that as man, ſo the whole Bible doth conſiſt of a body and a ſoul, the body is the better, the ſenſe is the ſoul of Scripture.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> Let not this diſcourage any zealous Chriſtian from exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf in the reading and ſtudy of holy Scripture: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do confeſſe, that the figurative forms uſed therein, do often make the Scripture obſcure.</p>
                  <p>For we do alſo affirme, that figures do ſometimes give light to our apprehenſion, and make the mind of God better known to us: as when Chriſt ſaith;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I am the good Shepheard:</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord is my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard:</hi> this doth make Chriſt better known to us in his carefull protection of us, and his watchfull keeping, and his plentifull feeding, and ſafe foulding of us, and in ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath taken advantage of the obſcurity of the Scripture, to forbid the tranſlation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, into the vernacle tongues of nations, and to prohibit lay
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104898:224"/>perſons, or any other without ſpeciall leave. Thus much I dare affirm, that holy Scripture are plain and eaſie in all dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall points, all the articles of faith are plainly ſet forth, and the whole doctrine of godly life, and the way to ſalvation is openly declared. So far our Church doth avouch, yet withall we muſt conſider, that there is a double plainneſſe of Scripture.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 Rationall and Intellectuall, which apprehendeth the true meaning of the words in Grammaticall conſtruction, in Logicall compoſition, and in Rhetoricall illuſtration, thus all the dogmaticall part of Divinity is plain to a naturall man, that is capable of theſe helps.</item>
                     <item>2 Spirituall and Metaphyſicall, which is, ſaving knowledge, and is the work of the Holy Ghoſt in us, making us thereby wiſe to ſalvation, this knowledg is both the daughter and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of faith, for by faith we hear the word, elſe it would not profit us, and by hearing commeth faith, elſe it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Therefore I muſt indite many of the learned of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of ſlander, who have given out in print, that we do hold the whole body of Scripture ſo eaſie, both in the whole, and in every part thereof, that any unlearned men &amp; women may read, and underſtand, all as they go, and that they need no interpreter. This no ſober man will affirm; but that the difficulty is not ſuch as ſhould deter us from the ſtudy thereof, rather that it is ſuch as inviteth us thereto, that we affirme.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 Though the Scripture be full of figures, let us not make figures where there are none, and ſtrein plain and evident Texts from their genuine and proper ſenſe, to forreign and far-fetcht myſteries, as the Papiſt doth often.</p>
                  <p>For when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ecce hic duo gladii,</hi> they underſtand the double power of <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo of al Popes as his ſucceſſours Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaticall and temporall; ſo on theſe words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He made two great lights, the greater to rule the day, the leſs to rule the night;</hi> that theſe two lights are the Pope to rule the day;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104898:225"/>that is to ſay, the Church: and the Emperour to rule the night, that is, the lay people.</p>
                  <p>Where note, that as the Moon borroweth all the light it hath of the Sun, So muſt the Emperour borrow all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Some of our own brethren have trode awry in this way, for an Article of Faith lyes bleeding in the unreſolved judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of many, by this fault of making a figure where none is.</p>
                  <p>The words of Chriſt, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell,</hi> are plain enough:</p>
                  <p>For we know that Chriſt had a ſoul, we know that there is an hell, and we hear Chriſt ſay; that God would not leave it there.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Calvine</hi> turns this into a figure, and his words be all oracles with ſome that take their upon truſt, his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure is that, <hi>deſcendit ad inferos diros in anima cruciatus dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati, ac perditi hominis pertulet:</hi> he deſcended into hell, that is, he bare in his ſoul all the torments of the damned.</p>
                  <p>Maſt. <hi>Perkins</hi> refuſeth this as the meaning of the article, for he ſaith, all this is conteined in the former: he ſuffered, was crucified dead.</p>
                  <p>And he findeth another figure in theſe words, by ſoul, he meaneth the body; and by hell, he meaneth the grave; for he thus rendreth it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He deſcended into hell,</hi> that is, he was held captive in the grave, and lay in bondage under death for three daies.</p>
                  <p>Which need not, for the Article that ſaith, he was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contemneth that: for then <hi>God did not ſuffer his holy one to ſee corruption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This turning of Articles of faith into figures, doth deſtroy faith, therefore without figure the ſafeſt way is to underſtand the word of the Prophets in their own proper ſenſe &amp; natural ſignification: by ſoul, to underſtand the living ſoul of Chriſt, which by death was ſeparated for a time from his body.</p>
                  <p>By hell, to underſtand the place of the damned, in which
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104898:225"/>Chriſt triumphed victoriouſly over the Devil and his angels, and brought away the keys thereof, that he might open it to the reprobate, and ſhut it again: the elect to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made, that, <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Let us alſo take heed, that where there is a plain figure, we do not underſtand that literally, to corrupt the Text: which was the errour of the Diſciplies, to whom when Chriſt had ſpoken of reſtoring the Kingdom to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it literally, of the temporall Kingdom of the Jews, which was meant of the ſpirituall Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>So the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> thought Chriſt had ſpoken of an Elementary water, and the Capernaites miſtook Chriſt, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bread of life.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, let common judgements take good counſel, how they expound Scriptures, leſt they pervert them to their own damnation, for as <hi>Aug.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Midian</hi> lay neer to that land, ſo that I underſtand the Text thus; That God caſt his fear upon people remote, and near hand, and ſhook them with trembling at his mighty power, when he brought his <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the promiſed Land; and this was ſo palpable and manifeſt, that the Church of God could not but take notice of it.</p>

                  <p>They ſaw a fair iſſue ready for timely ſucceſſion, ſo gratiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeaſoned with the ſalt of heavenly wiſedom from the firſt of their capacity and apprehenſion; that there remained no hope for their politique religion to finde footing in theſe Churches.</p>
                  <p>Their flouriſhing ſtate of Church and Common-welth was ſuch an affliction to them, that ſome Zealots of their Religion, the ſons of thunder could no longer contein themſelves, but their ſtudy was how to put their grief upon us, and to transfer our joy upon themſelves.</p>
                  <p>They ſhewed us the vvay of their rejoycing, their mercies vvere cruel, nothing could remove their grief at our vvelfare, but the deſtruction of the head and body, root and tree, and all in a day. And they that vvould have deſtroyed us thought, and the Jeſuites and Prieſts of the Roman Faith taught them to believe, that they ſhould do God good ſervice.</p>
                  <p>We ſee the mercies of that religion ſo clearly in this horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treaſon, that all that knovv and ſerve the God of peace; have juſt cauſe to eſteem Papiſts diſloyall ſubjects, ſecret enemies to the State; bloudy perſecutors of the Goſpell of peace.</p>
                  <p>Our ſtories are full of their malice, vvrackings, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſtarvings, burnings, hangings, and many exquiſite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments executed upon innocent and holy Martyrs.</p>

                  <p>What alterations could be here meant but thoſe that <hi>Job</hi> felt, that our Land and Church might complain: <hi>Thou haſt turned my Harp into mourning, and my Organs into the voice of them that weep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How did they ſwallow up the joy of this change, in hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expectation of ſucceſſe: but the children came to the birth, and there was no ſtrength to bring forth.</p>
                  <p>Their own fear came upon them, For it was <hi>Catesbyes</hi> own <hi>Lenvoy,</hi> to his revealed Treaſon; But, ſaith he, <hi>If this take not effect (as moſt of this nature miſcarry) the ſcandal will be ſo great to the Catholick Religion, as not onely our enemies, but our friends will with good reaſon condemn us.</hi> Thus did their minds miſ-give, and abodements of evil did ſecretly call upon them, to fly from the anger to come,</p>
                  <p>This diverted them a while from this execution, and put them into a new project; <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> was ſent (as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion under his own hand reporteth) to inform the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Spaine</hi> then coming in Ambaſſy from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to our Sovereigne, of the ſtate of the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> and to entreat his mediation to ſolicite our King for the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſome penall laws, and the admittance of the Engliſh Catholicks into the ranke of his other Subjects. <hi>Winter</hi> met with him at <hi>Bergen</hi> neer <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and by the meanes of <hi>Owen,</hi> an apoſtate Traitor, he had acceſſe to him, mooved him in his ſuite, and had a fair promiſe from him to do all good offices in that errand.</p>

                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:104898:229"/>But <hi>Owen</hi> diſcouraged that hope, ſaying, that he believed nothing leſſe, and that they ſought onely their own ends: meaning the ſtate of <hi>Spaine,</hi> holding ſmall accompt of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Owen</hi> animated the Treaſon, and promiſed to ſend <hi>Faux</hi> over to help to ſet it forward.</p>
                  <p>From thence <hi>Winter</hi> went to another of our fugitives, Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> to <hi>Oſtend,</hi> where he asked his opinion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if the Catholiques of <hi>England</hi> ſhould do any thing in <hi>England</hi> to help themſelves, the Arch-Duke would ſecond them? he anſwered, no: for all thoſe parts deſired peace with <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After all theſe deſpairs, they had no remedy to cure their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of envy at the gratious peace of this State, but their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-plot, in which none but profeſt. Papiſts within the land had any hand.</p>
                  <p>None that we can diſcover, but Prieſts and Jeſuites, here or abroad did blow the fire.</p>

                  <p>This was ſo great a wonder, that we read,</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The things moſt remarkable in that wonderfull work of God were theſe;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 That the waters of ſo great a River as <hi>Iordan</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil towards their head; for water being a ponderous body, doth naturally fall downward, and ſeeketh ſtill the lower
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104898:232"/>place; but God did make a wall of water to ſtop the decourſe of the ſtream, which was a work againſt nature: for the other part of the ſtream ran on, and left the land dry.</item>
                     <item>2 The ſecond wonder was the means that God uſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this great work: for the Prieſts that did bear the Arke muſt ſet the firſt foot into the River, for God ſaid;</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſſoon as the ſoals of the feet of the Prieſts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joſh 3 13.</note> 
                     <hi>that bear the Arke of the Lord, the Lord of all the Earth, ſhall reſt in the waters of</hi> Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, <hi>the waters of Jordan ſhall be cut off, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here was the Arke, the Sacrament viſible of Gods inviſible preſence, and the Prieſts of the Lord bearing it: they had the warrant of Gods Word to attempt this paſſage, and they did not ſo much as wet their feet in that river; no ſooner did the ſoals of their feet touch the water, but they fled from the Lord, not from the Prieſts; yet from the Prieſts as the Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, not that any vertue or efficacie was in the feet of the Prieſts, the vertue was in the Sacrament of Gods preſence, the Ark which they carried upon their ſhoulders: neither was the vertue of that wonder in the Saerament efficiently and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, but mediately and inſtrumentally.</p>
                  <p>It was the work of the <hi>Lord of all the Earth,</hi> whoſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the Arke, whoſe ſervants the Prieſts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 A third wonder was the faith of the Prieſts that did bear the Arke, who could believe a thing in nature ſo impoſſible, in reaſon ſo improbable, that they durſt attempt it both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their ovvn perſons, but eſpecially of the Ark of God vvhich they did bear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> vvanted faith in a leſſe matter, vvhen God bade him onely ſpeak to the Rock, he ſmote it tvvice, once in vain to puniſh his unbelief, once vvith ſucceſſe to fulfill Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>Yet the Prieſts believed faithfully, and obeyed vvvillingly, and did not debate the matter anxiouſly, or go on timerou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 A fourth wonder was in the time,<note place="margin">Joſh. 3.15.</note> for it was <hi>in the time of the harveſt when</hi> Jordan <hi>overfloweth all the banks,</hi> when there
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104898:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>was a great deal more river then channel, and the more water, the more wonder.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 We may adde here to a fifth, that when all the people were paſt over,<note place="margin">Joſh. 4.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Joſhua</hi> did command twelve men out of every Tribe a man, to return back again into the midſt of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and they were not prieſts, but lay-men, and they were not to follow the Ark, but to goe before it, and from thence, they muſt every man bring upon his ſhoulder a ſtone, and thoſe were ſet up in <hi>Gilgall</hi> for a monument of this paſſage, for the memoriall thereof to their children.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The laſt wonder was, that when the twelve men return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the midſt of the channell of <hi>Jordan,</hi> to the land which was for them to dwell in. The Prieſts following them with the Arke of God, the ſoals of their feet were no ſooner lifted upon the dry land, but</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The waters of</hi> Jordan <hi>returned to their place, and flowed over all his banks as they did before.</hi>

                  <p>So in the Goſpel, Chriſt hath honored his Miniſters, to whom he hath committed the office of the miniſtry of reconciliation: teaching by them, baptizing by them, binding and looſning by them, for though he do all theſe things himſelf, as he ſaith, <hi>Sine me nihil poteſtis facere,</hi> without me you can do nothing, yet he will do nothing ordinarily in theſe things without us, becauſe this is his Ordinance, and the eſtabliſhed conſtitution in his Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 As he uſed the miniſtry of <hi>Moſes</hi> in this great work of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the ſea,<note place="margin">Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This abated nothing of the honour of God, that he uſed the ſervice of his creatures, neither can this ſeparation of the waters be, therefore aſcribed to ſome naturall cauſes, ſeeing this wind was miraculouſly ſent of God to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Some enemies of God have ſlandred this miracle, and ſaid, that the paſſage of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was but an advantage taken of an extraordinary neap tide, which turns the truth into a lye, for
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104898:234"/>it is here added, that the vvaters vvere a vvall on both ſides of them.</p>
                  <p>The work it ſelf of dividing the ſea, that was the greateſt, what is the rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the force of an eaſt wind to part the waters in two, and to cut out a lane of dry land, in the midſt of the ſea for ſuch an armie to paſſe through on foot, to make the waters a fluent and liquid element to ſtand on both ſides, as a wall and fence to their paſſage.</p>
                  <p>Yet I muſt tell you that many learned have believed and written, that the waters of the ſea were divided in twelve pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and twelve lanes, cut out, for the twelve tribes to paſſe over every of the tribes a part, and by himſelf.</p>

                  <p>Theſe motives grew within themſelves, and they were their own luſts.</p>
                  <p>But God gave them over to theſe luſts and deſires, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to puniſh their cruelty to his people, and to make his name glorious in the deliverance of his Church, and in the conqueſt of the enemies thereof.</p>
                  <p>It is revenge enough in God upon man, to leave him to his own ways, for they lead him to deſtruction.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>For this favour of God to his Church is a ſpeciall grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his univerſall protection.</p>
                  <p>This it is that the Spouſe of Chriſt doth pray for. <hi>Set me as a ſeal on thy heart,</hi>

                  <p>That wiſh of the Church then was thus, and is now an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith: that prayer was then, and now is our Creed.</p>
                  <p>But much more evidently hath this eternall love of God to his Church in Chriſt <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhewed it ſelf: ſince Chriſt our Saviour was made manifeſt in the fleſh; and much more hath it extended, and dilated it ſelf, ſince he was believed on of the Gentiles; and preached to the world.</p>
                  <p>For when God once had fitted him with a body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with had given him a heart like ours, and ſuch an arm as we have, and ſuch hands, it hath been more diſcerned, how we were ſet as a ſeal upon that heart, how we are worne upon that arm, how we are ingraven in the Palms of thoſe hands. For that heart was pierced with a ſpear, thoſe hands were nailed to the Croſſe, and theſe be the ſtamps and Characters of his love to us.</p>
                  <p>And as the affection of love is noted to be moſt vehement in a woman, as <hi>David</hi> doth imply when he bewailed <hi>Jonathans</hi> death.</p>

                  <p>The Argument drawn from hence is ſtill the ſame, for from the former evidences of Gods great power and mercy ſhewed, and openly, declared unto the Church, they gather comfort to aſſure themſelves of the favour of God, toward them in this captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi>

                  <p>This bleſſing of the Apoſtle doth ſhew, that when the love of God is ſetled, there followeth grace and expreſſure of his favour, that bringeth forth inward conſolation, of the ſpirit preſent, good hope for the time to come, an eſtabliſhing of the heart in holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>This I name as the higheſt ſtep of our exaltation, becauſe this repairs in us the image of God, which is his holineſſe, and the true children of God do value this above their eternall life.</p>

                  <p>It is not the dark and horrid houſe of woe that maketh a ſoul miſerable in hell, but Gods diſpleaſure: <hi>ite maledicti:</hi> if an elect ſoul could be caſt thither, and retein the favour of God, hell would be an heaven to him, and his joy could not all the Devils of hell take from him, his night would be turned into day.</p>

                  <p>For faith gathered from Gods oath to the tribes, even his word: he addeth <hi>Selah,</hi> to ſhevv that vve may ſafely reſt there.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is becauſe, The Word of God is a ſure word, and thoſe things wherein men fail, are not incident to him.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 Whereas men do promiſe or ſwear raſhly, and without conſideration, as <hi>David</hi> did, when he ſwore that he would not leave one of the houſe of <hi>Nahall</hi> to make water againſt a wall, God cannot fail that way, becauſe he doth all things with ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth, and according to the counſail of his will.</item>
                     <item>2 Men do ſometimes vow and ſwear things utterly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and moſt wicked, as <hi>Herod</hi> did to <hi>Herodias</hi> daughter, to give her whatſoever ſhe demanded of him, which included the life of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt.
<p>So there were many that ſwore they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed <hi>Paul,</hi> our God cannot fail ſo far, he loveth righteouſneſſe, neither ſhall any evill dwell with him.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>3 Whereas many promiſe, and ſwear, what they mean not ever to perform, as <hi>Jacobs</hi> Sons in the Covenant, that they made of confederacy with <hi>Hamor</hi> the Son of <hi>Shechem:</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>Our God cannot lie.</hi>

                        <p>So then, if the Word of God be gone out of his mouth, we may build faith upon it, for heaven and earth may and ſhall paſſe away, ſo ſhal not one jod of the Word of God.</p>

                  <p>The promiſes of God to his Church, and his threatnings of ſin recorded in the living Book of his word are not antiquate, no age ſhall ever ſuperannate them, or put them out of full force and vertue.</p>

                     <hi>Verſe 10.</hi> The mountains ſaw thee, and they trembled, the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of the water paſſed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lift up his hands on high.</head>
                  <p>THeſe words have reference to the former wonders of Gods works, in which the Holy Ghoſt Poetically, and Rhethorically doth give life to things in-animate, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their yielding and giving vvay to Gods extraordinary operations, ſome underſtanding that; For ſuch impreſſion did the power of God make in the everlaſting mountains, as he calleth them before, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. and in the perpetuall hils that they gave way to his people, as if they had ſeen God himſelf, and that the feare of God had been upon them to make them tremble.</p>
                  <p>The like Poeticall ſtreine we have in the Pſalmiſt: <hi>What ailed ye mountains that ye skipped like ramms,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 114.6.</note> 
                     <hi>and ye little hils like young ſheep?</hi> And the words of <hi>David</hi> do ſeem to guide my judgement, to expound this place, not of the mountains upon the dry land, but with reference to the miracle of the paſſage of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> over <hi>Jordan,</hi> in which God by his power did make the waters of the river riſe up like mountains to ſtop their way, and yet not to ſuffer them to drown the neighbouring Continent, and this was effected with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary motion of the waters, leaping and skipping like Sheepe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore here is added, the over-flowing of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſed by, that is, it did not over-flow the way of the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> but beſtowed it ſelf in the raiſing up of the mountains of water: <hi>The deep uttered his voice:</hi> he meaneth the noiſe of the waters, running and ſwelling in heaps: <hi>And lift up his hands on high:</hi> for this riſing of the waters into ſuch huge hils, did give reſtimony of their yielding to the almighty power of God in his working, though contrary to their nature.</p>
                  <p>This expoſition of theſe words I imbrace, as moſt conſonant
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104898:245"/>to the web of the Scripture, yet I will not conceal from you, that ſome refer this trembling of the mountains, and this noiſe of the waters, figuratively, to the trembling of the Kings in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the noiſe of the people afraid, and melting in their hearts at the ſtrange paſſage of <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the red ſea firſt, and now at laſt through <hi>Jordan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whom I dare not follow, holding it dangerous to admit more figures then need, when ſome more literall ſenſe may be proper.</p>
                  <p>Others to refer this to the trembling of mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when God appeared to the people in the way, of which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And mount</hi> Sinai <hi>was altogether on a ſmoak,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exo. 9.18.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe the Lord deſcended upon it in fire, and the ſmoak thereof aſcended as the ſmoak of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this connexion of the trembling of the mountains, with the noiſe of the waters, doth make it probable to me, that it is one and the ſame miracle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magiſter Hiſtoriae</hi> felleth of a mountain in the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> neer to the river of <hi>Arnon,</hi> which ſuffered a violent earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake at the time of the entring of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but that is an Apocryphall relation, and the ſilence of the ſtory doth make it queſtionable, whether any ſuch thing were done.</p>
                  <p>The figurative and poetical form of ſpeech here uſed is in ſight.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The heaps of waters ſwelling to a very great height, are called mountains.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Here is attributed to them humane ſenſe, motions, and affections, as ſeeing, trembling, uttering of a voice, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of hands.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things are familiar and frequent all the Scripture through, eſpecially in the poeticall part thereof, as I have ſhewed.</p>

                     </label> and to ſerve him.</p>
                  <p>For that which the heathen do call nature in the creatures,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104898:246"/>is in religion the conſtant order which God hath eſtabliſhed in the univerſall machine and frame of the world, and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very perticular member and part thereof, ſerving Gods gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall providence: that which we call miraculous and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, is the perticular will of God upon occaſion, declered out of his ſingular and ſpeciall providence.</p>
                  <p>In both theſe, all creatures whatſoever do ſo ſerve him, as if they knew what they did. The <hi>Centurion</hi> did not keep his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in better awe, and had them not ſo ready at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as God hath his creatures, their nature is ſubject to rule, and that ſo as fire ſhal burne and not conſume, as in the buſh, waters ſhall ſtand in heaps, as in the paſſage through the red Sea, and here in my Text, in the river of <hi>Jordan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Water ſhall not put out ſire, the haile as watry ſubſtance ſhall mingle with fire in the ſame ſhoare, and <hi>Eliah</hi> ſhall call for ſire that ſhall lick up the water, and dry the ditches filled to the brim.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon hereof is becauſe there is nothing in the world that hath any being,<label type="milestone">

                  <p>The right of Creation without which nothing had any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the right of protection which keepeth all things in being, doth put all things in ſubjection under his feet, his will is their nature; and it is all one to the inanimate creature to ſerve his true will in an ordinary, and in a miraculous way: for his will is the ſoul that animateth them, and maketh them active, and he could have as eaſily let the ſea keep his courſe, and let the river of <hi>Jordan</hi> run on, and have brought his people over upon the face of the waters, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> walkt, as he made them a paſſage through.</p>

                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:104898:246"/>This ready obſequence of the inanimate creature to the will of God, doth upbraid man whom God made for himſelf, and his ſpecial honour, with much unworthineſſe; for things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life owe leſſe to God for creation then things animate, much leſſe then man, to whom God gave a living ſoul, made in the image of God, &amp; having but one law of reſtraint put upon him, broke it, and brought a pollution of himſelf, which like the leproſie of <hi>Gehezi</hi> runneth in all his poſterity.</p>

                  <p>Do not we thank God for it, and take it for a high favour that he made us men, and did not make us ſtones, or plants, worms, or flies, ſerpents or toads; or any other kind of hatefull or hurtfull creature.</p>
                  <p>But yet, if we live not to ſerve him, and to do his will, our condition had been much more happy, to have been the worſt

                  <p>I will not goe from the example in my Text, to teach you what we are, for by originall generation we runne like <hi>Jordan</hi> in a full and ſwift current, into the great and wide Sea of the world, and there we looſe our ſelves in thoſe ſalt waters.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes as <hi>Jordan</hi> in harveſt times, that is, in times of our plenty and fulneſſe, and when we have eaſe, and whatſoever our heart deſireth, we do overflow our banks, and exceed all meaſure.</p>
                  <p>But when the Preiſts of the Lord do bring the Ark of God into us, that is, when we come to have a ſenſe and a feeling of Religion, and the fear of God, then do we recoile and ſtrive againſt nature, and overcome nature, and we learn to do the good, that we would not do.</p>
                  <p>For truly religion doth carry us againſt winde and tyde: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion leads us all up-hill, and he that will follow Chriſt muſt deny himſelf, ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth. <hi>Vero ego, &amp; non amplius ego, ſed vivit in me Chriſtus:</hi> I live, yet not I, but Chriſt in me.</p>

                  <p>This is the wonder that <hi>Habakkuk</hi> our Prophet doth here commemorate, a miracle yet freſh in the memory of the Church, yet by computation of times from the time of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> when this was done to this time of <hi>Habakkuk:</hi> when this is remembred were paſt, more then 700 years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Habakkuk</hi> doth well to remember this, for of all the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that God wrought for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> this was the greateſt; here Heaven fought againſt Earth, the Sun and Moon ſtood ſtill to give light to the Battail, and the faithfull witneſſes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104898:249"/>(ſo the Sun is called) ſtaid his courſe to bear witneſſe how God fought for <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may truly ſay to <hi>Iſrael, Tibi militat aether:</hi> Obſerve the words of the Prophet, how well they follow the hiſtory in <hi>Joſhua. Habukkuk</hi> ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Sun and Moon ſtood ſtill in their habitation,</hi> they ſtood in their ſeverall ſphear wherein they move, for theſe be their habitations, and note that they both ſtood ſtil, Sun and Moon. For the Moon borrowing all her light of the Sun, had ſhe kept her courſe while the Sun had ſtood ſtill the length of a day, there had been great irregularity of motion in theſe Caeleſtiall bodies, from the conſtant order ſet them by their Maker in their Creation.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve alſo, that he doth not ſay the earth ſtood ſtill, but the Sun: it had been, as ſome ſaid, the Earth and the Moon ſtood ſtill as the Sun and the Moon, and our underſtanding would have as ſoon apprehended, if that new Aſtronomy had had been then revealed, which ſome of our Empericks, and Journeymen in that excellent Science of Aſtronomy have of late revived in their Almanacks, telling the world that they have long been in a wrong belief, that the Sun moveth, and the earth is fixed, for they believe that the Sun is fixed, and the earth is moved.</p>
                  <p>And to evade the cleer evidence of this text, which tels it for a wonder that the Sun ſtood ſtill, they ſay, this is ſpoken to our capacity, becauſe to our ſight it ſo ſeemeth, that the Sun moveth, and the earth is fixed, but indeed it is otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Our capacity I think hath much wrong done in this, for if the Word of God had told us, that God had created the Sun to ſtand ſtill, and the Earth to move, it is more likely that we ſhould have taken his Word for it, and have believed it as it is, as well as now we believe it, as it appears.</p>
                  <p>We are neither incapable nor incredulous, but that many againſt the letter of Scripture have written, and made more believe, that the Sun ſtands ſtill from the creation.</p>
                  <p>The common defence of this opinion grounded upon Gods application of himſelf, to humane capacity, doth make figures
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104898:250"/>in ſtory where is no need, and maketh <hi>David</hi> a man of ſmall judgment in the knowledge of the Sun, who ſaith, that <hi>God hath ſet a tabernacle for the Sun in the Heavens,</hi> (called here) an habitation, <hi>Which is a Bridegroome comming out of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and rejoyceth, as a ſtrong man, to run his race.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His going forth is from the end of the Heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it.</p>
                  <p>Doth not this Prophet ſpeak of the glory of God, declared in the motion, not the ſtation of the Sun? or in the glory of God ſhewed in our opinion of the Suns motion, not in the truth thereof.</p>
                  <p>Greater ſecrets then this are revealed in holy Scripture, which are againſt the vouchie of the outward ſenſe, or the rationall diſcourſe of man, and no doubt, but if the Sun had ſtood ſtill, and the earth that we live upon had moved, when this miracle was by the ſpirit of truth recorded, it had been ſo ſet down to us, as followeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[At the light of thine Arrows they went, at the ſhining of thy glittering ſpear.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The meaning, I conceive, to be this, that the Sun and Moon did not now keep their ordinary motion appointed in their Creation, but by a miraculons diſpenſation they attended the arrows of God and his ſpears.</p>
                  <p>For God declared himſelf in this war, to be the God of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> by ſhining arrows and glittring ſpears, he meaneth not onely the arms of <hi>Iſrael</hi> his people, but the apparent demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his owne miraculous and extraordinary power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in this war;</p>
                  <p>For you heard in the ſtory, that God <hi>caſt down great ſtones from Heaven upon them, which ſlew more then</hi> Iſraels ſword did.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were arrows of God, and his ſpears with which he fought for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they are called bright and gliſtring both.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 Becauſe the Sun-ſhining upon theſe great hailſtones reflected a dazeling light from them, as experience telleth us, both in ſnow, ice, hailſtones, and all waterie bodies.</item>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104898:251"/>God, which muſt be underſtood of the adoption of grace, for by right of creation all people of the world are Gods people.</p>
                  <p>This was <hi>Iſraels</hi> glory, and it was alſo their ſafety, that they were Gods people, and how they came to be ſo, <hi>Moſes</hi> will tell.</p>

                  <p>And <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Junius</hi> do ſo apply the text, Mr. <hi>Calvine</hi> lead them all into this Expoſition.</p>
                  <p>Others conceive, that the former commemoration is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and they that are before called Gods people, are here called Gods annointed: for whereſoever there is election, there is unction, and we may ſay of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that God annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with the oile of gladneſſe above all their fellow na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for <hi>David</hi> ſaith; <hi>Non fecit taliter.</hi>

                     </gap> his <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which moveth me to refer this to Chriſt, who was the bond of that love which knit God ſo to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for whoſe ſake, God was ſo favourable to <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Calvine</hi> doth confeſſe, that this hath reference to Chriſt, and includeth all the favours of God declared to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> from their coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to the laſt mercy ſhewed to them, to have come to them, <hi>non niſi interpoſito Mediatore,</hi> not without a Mediatour.</p>
                  <p>But he addeth, that the promiſe of Chriſt did more cleely appear, and was more manifeſtly revealed in the reigne of <hi>David</hi> then before, which might give comfort to the Church in diſtreſſe, that makes Maſter <hi>Calvine</hi> go ſo low as <hi>Davids</hi> reigne, to apply theſe words.</p>

                  <p>So then I underſtand that God went forth with his anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is, with Jeſus Chriſt, to ſave his people, and there is the the life bloud of all the comfort in this whole Pſalme of the Church; and by this faith, by faith in this Meſſiah the juſt ſhall live.

                  <p>
                     <hi>[Thou woundeſt the head out of the houſe of the wicked.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the houſe of the wicked, the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> is here meant, and by the head that God wounded, either the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and policy, or the ſovereignty and power of the Land is meant; for none of the Kings of the land could ſtand before <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo that the very head of the houſe was wounded.</p>

                     <hi>[By diſcovering the foundation to the neck.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the manner of Gods working againſt the head of the houſe of the wicked, by making the foundation naked; that is, digging up the very roots thereof, by an utter extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Inhabitants of this land.</p>
                  <p>It was <hi>Edoms</hi> cry againſt <hi>Jeruſalem, Raſe it, Raſe it:</hi> the Margent: <hi>make bare even the foundation thereof,</hi>

                  <q>Suis &amp; ipſa Roma viribus ruit.</q>
                  <p>He declareth here the extent of the victory not onely to their walled Towns, and defenced Cities, but even to the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and Hamlets of the Land: ſo that no part or corner of the Land eſcaped the hand of God, or the poſſeſſion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but God who promiſed them that land, gave it them, and gave it all into their hands.</p>
                  <p>This, as it hath a general extent to the whole ſtory of <hi>Iſraels</hi> conqueſts, ſo it may have a more perticular reference to the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104898:252"/>ſtory of that war made in the behalf of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> where the five Kings that made war againſt <hi>Gibeon,</hi> hid themſelves for ſafety in a cave at <hi>Makkedah:</hi> and that cave choſen for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, proved a priſon for their forth-coming, and <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſent men to roule great ſtones to ſtop the mouth of the cave till he had finiſhed the war,<note place="margin">Joſh. 10.16.</note> and then he brought them forth and ſlew them, and buried them in that cave.</p>
                  <p>Thus the head of the Villages were beaten with their owne ſtaves, and that cave which the Kings choſe for their ſafety was firſt made the trap to catch them, then the priſon to hold them faſt, and at laſt, the ſepulcher to bury them.</p>
                  <p>Yet more perticular reference may it have to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Midianites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judg. 7.</note> for in that battail the Lord decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his ſtrength for <hi>Iſrael</hi> mervellouſly, for he ſaid to <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi> their Captain.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In concluſion, God would have no more to go up againſt <hi>Midian,</hi> but three hundred men.</p>
                  <p>Now the Army of the <hi>Midianites</hi> was great, as appeareth in the former Chapter, ver. 33.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Yet God would have no more to go againſt <hi>Midian</hi> but three hundred men againſt this great Army, of whom he ſaith before: that <hi>they came as Graſhoppers for multitude,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And they had much vexed and impoveriſhed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the ſtory ſaith.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Iſrael</hi> had the victory by thoſe three hundred men, who being divided into three Companies, in the beginning of the middle watch of the night, when the ſigne was given by <hi>Gideon,</hi> every man brake a pitcher of earth that was in his hand, and held their lamps in their left hands, and their trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets in their right hands to ſound withall, and cryed, <hi>The ſword of the Lord and of Gideon, and they ſtood every man in his place.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>And the Lord ſet every mans ſword againſt his fellow through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the hoaſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judg. 7.22.</note> Here it is plain, how God beat them with their own ſtaves, and ſlew them with their own ſwords.

                  <p>Their ſecret comming to devoure the poor, it is well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the ſtory.</p>
                  <p>And ſo it was when <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſowen,<note place="margin">Judg. 6 3.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Midianites came up, and the Amalakites, and the children of the Eaſt, even they came up againſt them. And they encamped againſt them,</hi>

                  <p>Here they aſſaulted them ſecretly, by ſudden incurſions upon them, and they came out as a whirl-wind by ſudden violence, and they made them poor.</p>

                  <p>He proveth it by the example of <hi>Eliah,</hi> who though he were a man ſubject to the like paſſions, as we are, <hi>he prayed earneſtly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth in three years, and ſix moneths.</hi>

                  <p>When men pray as they ought, they know God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they know and confeſſe him the faithfull Creatour, the mercifull redeemer, the gracious preſerver, the bounteous rewarder of men.

                  <p>We finde in Scripture watching and faſting often joyned with prayer, as outward means to tame and ſubdue the fleſh, that it may be the leſſer able to reſiſt the power of the ſpirit, for the ſpirit is willing in the ſervant of God, but the fleſh is weak.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There is no part of Gods worſhip that hath ſo many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to impoſe it on us, as prayer hath in both the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, none that we have ſo many examples of great ſucceſſe and prevayling with God, none that we have ſo good means to perform as prayer: none that hath ſo many promiſes made to it in holy Scripture.</p>

                  <p>The point then here taught is, that in all wars which are juſt in reſpect of God who ſmiteth them, God is the leader, and the protector of his armies, who giveth them both ſtrength to fight and victory in battail.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were Gods wars by which <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſetled in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and they were the wars of God, by which <hi>Iſrael</hi> was led away captive into <hi>Babel.</hi> you heard God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſay ſo.<note place="margin">Hab. 1.6.</note>

                  <p>God brought in his <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the ſword, and by the ſword he carrieth them out of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">note.</note> the hand of the Lord is in both.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, whatſoever preparations of war, Gods ſervants do make to hold or to recover their own right, to relieve the diſtreſſes of others, or to ſuppreſſe the injuries of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, they muſt commit their cauſe to the Lord, and ſeek their ſtrength from him, and depend on him for their ſucceſſe.</p>
                  <p>But as God is the author and manager of all wars, ſo is he the ſpeciall protectonr of thoſe that he hath ſeparated from the world to be his Church and peculiar people, as in the ſtory of <hi>Iſraels</hi> paſſage you have heard.</p>

                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:104898:258"/>In this war, God did march before his <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and caſt the fear of them upon them all.</p>
                  <p>This is a great advantage in all wars, to have God on their ſides, for as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>If the Lord had not been on our ſide, when men roſe up againſt us, they had ſwallowed us up, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then is God a ſpeciall protectour, when he directeth his war to the good of them whom he protecteth, and marcheth in fury againſt their enemies.</p>
                  <p>And thus it was with <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they took poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as you have heard. <hi>For they gate not the Land in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, by their own arm, neither did their own arm ſave them,</hi>

                  <p>The diſtreſſed have a ſpeciall warrant to call upon God, and it was the voice of the Church, when the Arke removed to ſay, <hi>Exurgat Deus diſſipentur inimici ejus:</hi> let God ariſe, and let his enemies be ſcattered.</p>
                  <p>God is mercifull to our land, and Church, that we yet live in peace, it is full of comfort, when God marcheth before his Church in their wars, but it is much more happineſſe when he biddeth us go to our chambers, and ſhut the door after us, and tarry a while till the ſtorm of troubles over-blow.</p>
                  <p>But then it is moſt joyous, hen he giveth peace within our walls, and plenty within our palaces.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we lived hitherto by the favour of the God of peace, and it ſhal do well that we do lay this example to heart: For the ſame God that marched before <hi>Iſrael</hi> to plant them in, doth now march before the <hi>Chald<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Sin hath made this change: are we more in the favour of God then <hi>Iſrael</hi> was, or have we ſinned leſſe then they did, that their evils ſhould not come on us.</p>

So that the Sun ſhal not ſmite us by day, nor the Moon by night.</p>
                  <p>For as God created us to his own image, ſo he fitted to his only begotten Son a body in our image, he was made of a woman, and ſo ſoon as his word had made him the promiſed ſeed, ſo ſoon was he crucified for us, and was the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the World.</p>
                  <p>Then did he take his Church into his boſome, and married her to himſelf, and they became one body, and ever ſince his Angels have charge over her to keep her in all her ways, and this muſt comfort <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that God vvent before them vvith his anointed, to ſetle them in the promiſed Land.</p>

For all the knovvledg that they have, all the vviſedome in arts and ſciences be the gifts of the holy ghoſt, but they have no portion at all in the office of Chriſt, he vvas not anointed for them.</p>
                  <p>From hence the Apoſtle doth conclude, that God hath not forſaken the Jevvs, but that they ſhall be called again, for he ſaith. <hi>Hath God caſt away his people?</hi> he anſvvereth: <hi>God hath not caſt away his people whom he foreknew.</hi>

                  <q>De Verborum interpretatione.</q>
                  <p>It ſeemeth to me cleer againſt all queſtion, that this text hath reference to the wonderfull paſſage of <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the red ſea, of which mention is made before, Verſe 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Was thy wrath againſt the ſea, that thou didſt ride upon thy hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and chariots of thy ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words expreſſe that miracle very fully and fitly, for where it is ſaid. <hi>Thou didſt walk through the ſea:</hi> this hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that which we read concerning this paſſage over the red ſea: <hi>Exodus</hi> 14. In which this is memorable, that God went before the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> on the ſhoare, but it is ſaid, when God gave <hi>Moſes</hi> direction to lift up his rod, and ſtretch forth his hand over the ſea to divide it, <hi>Moſes</hi> having ſo done. <hi>The Angel of God which went before the camp of</hi> Iſrael, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/>
                     <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and went behind it, and the pillar of cloud went from before their face, and ſtood behind them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And it came between the camp of the Egyptians,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
                     <hi>and the camp of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and it was a cloud of darkneſſe to them:</hi> i.e <hi>to the Egyptians, and it gave light by night to theſe, that is, to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſo that the one came not neer the other all night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſtory ſheweth how God did walk through the ſea, even between the two camps.</p>
                  <p>The power of Gods word went before them, the preſence of his Angel went behind them, God himſelf carried the dark lanthorn, which kept all light from the Egyptians, and ſhewed a cleer light to <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The horſes of God here mentioned are the emblems of ſtrength, courage and ſpeed. For thus was <hi>Iſrael</hi> relieved through the heap of the great waters, that is, on the way made through the ſea, which was gathered in heaps on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:104898:268"/>So the words are plain and eaſie.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of them is a repetition of that great wonder of the conduct of <hi>Iſrael, per mare,</hi> through the ſea, of which I have formerly ſpoken at large, and now remaineth that we ſearch the reaſon why, this one ſpeciall miracle is here again repeated. That is,</p>
                  <p>Becauſe this was the greateſt miracle of power and mercy,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> which made the name of God glorious amongſt all nations, and the fame whereof was furtheſt ſpread abroad in the world, for never was the like heard of before or ſince.</p>
                  <p>Yet I will not conceal from you, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> writing this ſtory of the diviſion of the ſea for the paſſage of <hi>Iſrael, to give</hi> it the more credite. <hi>Ne quis diſcredat verbo miraculi:</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a like wonder,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Antiquit</hi> 2 <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</note> that God intending by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, to deſtroy the Perſian Kingdom, did open the like paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the <hi>Pamphilian</hi> ſea to <hi>Alexander</hi> and his army, he addeth, <hi>Id quod omnes teſtantur,</hi> that which all do witneſs, who wrote the ſtory of <hi>Alexanders</hi> conqueſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> who writeth of purpoſe the life and acts, and death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſaith no more of it but this, <hi>Mare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum itur in Pamphiliam aperuerat:</hi> which being aſcribed to <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf, doth declare it no miraculous paſſage.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Strabo</hi> cleereth it thus, that this ſea was no other, then ſuch as we have within our own land, which we call Waſhes, wherein the ſea forſaketh the ſands at an ebbe, and leaveth them bare and paſſable, on foot or horſe-back, and he ſaith, that <hi>Alexander</hi> paſſed his army through theſe waſhes, but being belated, the waters returned upon them before they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſhoare of <hi>Pamphilia, ut to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Joſephus</hi> was ill adviſed to parallel this paſſage with the <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſage through the red ſea, ſeeing there were ſo many diſpariſons, and whereas he ſeemed to labour to give credit to <hi>Moſes</hi> his hiſtory, by this unlike example, he rather blemiſhed the glory of this ſuperadmirable miracle.</p>
                  <p>There is not any of the great wonders that God wrought for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo often remembred in Scripture as this is, and where

                  <p>You ſee by this Apoſtle, that this is a memorable thing, and he would not have us ignorant of it, &amp; if we know it, he would not have us forget it, there is continual uſe of it in the Church; even ſo long as baptiſme continueth therein.</p>
                  <p>For that is the ſcope of the Apoſtle in the beginning of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104898:270"/>that Chapter, to ſhew that the Church of the Jews, as they had Sacraments of their own Circumciſion, and the Lords Paſſeover, ſo had they types and figures of our two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alſo.</p>
                  <p>The type and repreſentation of our Baptiſme was their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the red ſea.</p>
                  <p>The type of our Lords Supper was the water out of the rock and Manna.</p>
                  <p>But they and we do all receive the ſame ſpirituall meat and drink, that is Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>So that this paſſage over the red ſea doth figure our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, here is <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Miniſter of the Sacrament, here are <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the receivers of it, and here is water the element, and the cloud, the ſign of Gods preſence: here is <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, the perſons baptized, preſerved in theſe waters, and here is King <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his hoaſts, that is, Satan and our hereditary cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions drowned and deſtroyed in the ſame waters.</p>
                  <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith, I would not that ye ſhould be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this thing which admoniſheth both you and us that are your miniſters.</p>

                  <p>This ſheweth that the often preaching and learning and remembring the doctrine of our Baptiſme, is a moſt neceſſary leſſon in the ſchool of Chriſt, that we do not enter into a new peace with the Egyptians, whom God hath drowned in the red ſea, that we do not revive and quicken in us thoſe things which the laver of new byrth hath purged, by ſuffering ſin to reign in our mortall bodies, and by obeying it in the luſts thereof.</p>

                  <p>A good life and a well governed converſation, doth not fear the voyce of God: the Word of God is the light which God hath ſet up in his Church to guide her feet in the wayes of peace, they that do evill, hate the light, and will not come neer it, leſt their-works ſhould be reproved, the children of the light reſort to it, and call upon God, ſearch my reins and my heart, and ſee if there be any way of wickedneſſe in me.</p>
                  <p>This fear of the Church is not joyned either with obſtinacy againſt God, or murmuring at his judgments, or deſpair of his mercy, it is that fear, which is one of the effects of a godly ſorrow, and it is one of the documents to true repentance, it is the hammer and mallet of God, wherewith he bruiſeth us, and breaketh us, that we may be truly humbled under his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty

                  </p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> between the children of God, and the children of this world, for the ungodly are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the hand of God, but the ſinner contemneth, but the righteous layeth it to his heart, ſo ſaith the Church: <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up they wil not ſee,</hi>

                     <hi>but they ſhall ſee and be aſhamed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This alſo ſerveth for conſolation of the Church, for let them not be too much dejected with conſideration either of Gods revealed wrath, or their own juſt fear, no, though their fear do ſhake and ſtagger their very faith for a time, for God will not forſake them unto deſpair, but will let ſome of the beams of grace ſhine even through the clouds of fear to comfort them, <hi>David</hi> felt it,<note place="margin">Pſal. 56.3.</note> and confeſt it, ſaying: <hi>What time I am afraid, I will truſt in thee.</hi> See how they grow together, fear and faith.</p>
                  <p>But this is objected as an argument againſt that doctrine of the aſſurance of ſalvation,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> that a child of God may have in this life, for it is urged: Can a man that ſtandeth aſſured of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God to him in Chriſt Jeſus be ſo ſhaken with fear, as the Church here confeſſeth.</p>
                  <p>We anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That fear of temporall ſmart in this life is naturall,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> and may be in the ſons of God, it was in the Sonne of God Jeſus Chriſt, and it may be without ſin, and the elect, although they fear the judgments of God on earth, yet they doubt not, but that their names are written in heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That fear is not againſt faith, which is quick and ſenſible of the wrath and judgments of God: it is <hi>Cos fidei</hi> the Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of faith, it puts a better edg upon it, and ſerves to teach us to lay ſo much the faſter hold upon Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Courage either to reſiſt an evill <hi>ingruent</hi> without a right
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104898:276"/>knowledg of it, or to bear an evill incumbent, without a right underſtanding both of the Authour of it, the cauſe of it, or the end of it, or the meaſure of it, is not courage but ſtupidity.</p>
                  <p>But when we do rightly know God to lay his hand on us for ſin, or hear him threaten us with the rod: is it not time to fear, and to pray with <hi>Jeremie: Be not a terrour to me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 17.17.</note> 
                     <hi>for thou art my hope in the day of evill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 Fear and faith go together, in reſpect of the temporall judgments of God, becauſe the threatnings of temporall judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not always peremptory, but oft-times conditionall, therefore the King of <hi>Niniveh</hi> proclaiming a generall. Faſt and repentance in <hi>Niniveh,</hi> had this encouragement:<note place="margin">Jonah 3.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Who can tell, if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger that we periſh not?</hi> God himſelf hath put us into this comfort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 18.7.</note> 
                     <hi>and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Kingdome, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If that nation againſt whom I have pronounced,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 
                     <hi>turn from their evill, I will repent of the evill that I thought to do unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that this fear of the temporall judgments of God, doth no way weaken the faithfull aſſurance that we have conceived of eternall ſalvation, rather it ſtrengtheneth it, yea, the more that we either taſt or fear the puniſhing hand of God here, the more do we deſire the releaſe of us hence, which is reſt from all labours.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 They that take this fear to be contrary to faith, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the favour of God do miſtake it, for it is true, that a doubtfull and deſpairing fear doth deſtroy faith, but the faithfull cannot fall into that fear, becauſe God preſſeth not his temptations above that which his children are able to bear.</p>
                  <p>And fear in them is but contrary to preſumption, it is not contrary to faith, which thus appears, becauſe this fear doth not make the ſervants of God give over the work of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, rather it makes them double their endevours, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the time.</p>
                  <p>But in the reprobate their fear doth make them give hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven gone from them, and profeſſe it loſt labour to ſerve God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:104898:277"/>
                     <hi>Ye have ſaid, it is in vain to ſerve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinances,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 3.14.</note> 
                     <hi>and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hoaſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another:</hi> that is, encouraged one another, and it is ſaid, the Lord hearkned and heard it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The effect of this fear: <hi>That I might reſt in the day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This alſo ſheweth that this fear of the Church was not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from faith, for it is entertained of purpoſe to ſettle the heart, and to give it reſt in the day of trouble.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but often remember that ſweet ſaying of <hi>Auſtine: Medicina eſt quod pateris,</hi> thy ſuffering is the Phyſick, for the Phyſick that we take to purg the ill humours of the body, doth make the body more ſick for the time, and ſo do the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</p>
                  <p>The fear of judgment threatned, is more pain to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, then the ſenſe of the judgment inflicted.</p>
                  <p>It is a note of the juſt, that they rejoyce in tribulations, yet you ſee they fear tribulations before they come, which ſhews that the bitterneſſe of that cup, is more in the cauſe then in the effect.</p>
                  <p>The righteous in theſe threatnings do behold God in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, themſelves in the guilt of provocation, and nothing goeth ſo neer the heart of a godly man, as that his God ſhould take any unkindneſſe at him, for in his favour is life.</p>
                  <p>To help this, when God threatneth, the juſt man feareth, and that fear doth both remember him of the occaſion of this judgment, and compoſeth him to repentance of his ſin, and to prayer, to divert it, or to patience in it.</p>
                  <p>Fear joyned with faith, prepareth us for peace and reſt in the day of trouble.<label type="milestone">

                  <p>Let no man ſay, the <hi>Pope</hi> is a man of Sin, and a maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Idolatry, an uſurper upon the royall prerogatives of Jeſus Chriſt: he advanceth himſelf above all that is called God, and is worſhipped, hee is an incroacher upon the rights and honours, and power of Princes, and uſurpeth a tranſcendent juriſdiction over them, a mainteiner of treaſon, and murther of Kings, a Coiner of Articles of Faith, an hider of the Word of God, a maker of counter-laws, againſt the Law of God: therefore neither he nor his religion ſhall ever prevail againſt the Profeſſours of the truth of God.</p>

                  <p>The fig-tree ſaith; ſhould I forſake my ſweetneſſe and my good fruit.</p>
                  <p>The vine ſaith; ſhould I leave my wine which cheareth God and man.</p>
                  <p>You ſee of how excellent uſe theſe fruits were; two of them uſed in the ſpeciall ſervice of God, Oil, and Wine, and often is the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> praiſed for fruitfulneſſe, in reſpect of theſe trees growing there, which every ſoil doth not yield: they are all of excellent uſe both for food and medicine, and <hi>David</hi> ſaith of Wine, that it maketh glad the heart of man, of Oile, that it maketh him have a cheerfull countenance.</p>
                  <p>The failing of theſe, which the ſoil did naturally bring forth, doth ſhew that God had called in his bleſſing, which

                  <p>St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> goeth higher in the myſticall ſurveigh of theſe words, and looketh up to the future glory of the Church, ſaying,</p>

                  <p>The laſt words of the Pſalm, are a dedication thereof, to the uſe of the Church, dedicating it to the chief ſinger, to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Church muſique, that it may be ſung in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                  <p>The words are taken from <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> and applyed to this perticular occaſion of the Church. From whence we are taught, what uſe we may make of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms in our fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent reading and meditation of them.</p>
                  <p>Our Church hath divided the Pſalms into ſo many equall portions for our reading, that in every thirty days, ſuch as can read, may read over the whole book of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes, and it is no great task for every one of us, ſo to read them over pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately in our houſes: the benefit is great that will redound to them, that ſhall do this, for this will our experience finde, that St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> long ago hath teſtified of the book of Pſalms, that it is, <hi>Communis quidam bonae doctrinae theſaurus,</hi> a common ſtore-houſe of good learning: it will inſtruct the ignorant, it will draw on forward thoſe that are incipients, it will perfect
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104898:283"/>thoſe that are proficients, it will comfort all ſorts of afflictions, <hi>veteribus animarum vulneribus novit mederi, &amp; recentibus reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium applicare,</hi> it knows how, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He that would pray to God, may make choice here of fit forms dictated by the Spirit of God, to petition God upon all occaſions, whatſoever he would deſire of God, either to give him, or to forgive him.</p>
                  <p>He that would make confeſſion of his ſins to God, is here furniſhed &amp; accommodated with the manner of ſearching and ripping up of the conſcience, and laying the hid man of the heart open before God.</p>
                  <p>He that would make confeſſion of praiſe, hath his mouth filled with forms of praiſe, to ſet forth the goodneſs of God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in perticular to himſelf, or in general, to the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>He that is merry, and rejoyceth in the Lord, may finde here the muſique of true joy, and may from hence gather both matter and manner of Jubilation: you ſee that the Church in my text reſorteth to this ſtore houſe of comfort.</p>
                  <p>He that findeth himſelf dul and heavy in the duties of Gods ſervice, may here finde cheerfull ſtrains of muſique to quicken his dead affections, and to put life into them.</p>
                  <p>Many are too well conceited of their own ſufficiency for thoſe holy ſervices of God, ſo that in confeſſion of ſins, in prayer or in prayſing God, they over-ween their own meaſure of the ſpirit of God, and are too much wedded to their own forms of addreſſe to God.</p>
                  <p>But let no man deſpiſe theſe helps, the beſt of us all need them, &amp; the moſt able amongſt us ſhal abate nothing from his own ſufficiency, to borrow of them, we are ſure that the Holy Ghoſt hath indited them: and if a wiſe judgment do make choice and fit application of them to our ſeverall purpoſes, and occaſions, we cannot more holily or more effectually expreſſe our ſelves then in them, the ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us plentifully by them.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>The Book of God is thick ſown with examples and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with doctrine and uſe, with aſſertions and experience of this truth, and it is ſo ſealed to the perpetuall conſolation of the Church of God, that when Chriſt left his ſheep among Wolves, ſaying: <hi>In the world you ſhall have affliction.</hi> He left the Holy Ghoſt in his Church in the office, and under the name and title of a comforter: to aſſure this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> gives a good reaſon hereof,<label type="milestone">

                  <p>The true Church of God, when the ambition of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be univerſall Biſhop began to ſway Religion to the ſervice of humane policy, then began to loſe of her full num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, many of them, moſt of them defecting to popery and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition: the true profeſſors of the Goſpel were purſued
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:104898:284"/>with all kinds of bloudy perſecution, and in many years, the true Church of God lived in concealment, yet God did never ſuffer this little remaining ſpark to be quite put out, and when the Pope thought himſelf abſolute Lord of all, then aroſe <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> an arrow out of their own quiver, and in the low ebbe of the true Church, he oppoſed the Pope, and put a new life into the true Chriſtian Church, which ever ſince his time hath grown to a cleerer light, and the man of ſin is more and more revealed, and the myſtery of ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe detected, and in many parts of Chriſtendome, the Pope ejected, as an uſurper both in Eccleſiaſticall Hierarchy, and temporall Sovereignty.</p>
                  <p>At this time, this poor Church doth ſuffer perſecution in <hi>France,</hi> and is threatned with utter extirpation.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Proteſtants feel the uttermoſt of extremity: the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> and the Kings Children remain under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and in exile from their inheritance, and their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try invaded and depopulated doth groan under the fury of war, Religion is oppreſſed: the fig-tree, and the vine, and olive fail, the earth is not husbanded to profit, to feed the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: In this extremity, what comfort ſurviveth but this? that our God, the husband of his Church will not chide continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, nor reſerve his anger from generation to generation, but even in this extremity of diſtreſſe, we have joy in his favour, and love to his Church.</p>
                  <p>This holy care of Religion now aſſaulted, and the naturall care that our loyall allegiance to our Sovereign and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doth lay upon us, inciteth us to joyn, as one man with u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited ſtrength to work for God and his truth to the uttermoſt of our beſt abilities, and who knoweth whether God having crowned our land, ſo many years with peace and truth, doth now try us what we will do for Religion and peace, and how forward we will be in his cauſe, and how charitably compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate of the afflictions of our brethren abroad: wherein, if we ſhall acquite our ſelves like the children of light, and the ſons of peace, we may prevent a further tryall of us neerer hand in our own land.</p>

                     <hi>Impius haec tam culta novalia miles habebit, Barbarus has ſege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes?</hi> ſhall we look on whilſt Papiſts poſſeſſe the inheritance of Proteſtants, while ſuperſtition and Idolatry uſurpeth the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, where the holy worſhip of God, and the goſpell of truth and peace, have been ſo many years gloriouſly mainteined?</p>
                  <p>Hia Majeſtie hath well acquited himſelf to us to be a Prince of peace, who hath with unmeaſurable expence aſſaid, by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation and treaties, to compoſe the bloudy wars in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, with fair conditions of peace; he hath ſhewed himſelf tender in the caſe of Chriſtian bloud, and he would have all the Chriſtian world bear him witneſſe, that if he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the inheritance of his children in peace, he would not draw a ſword, nor hazard a life in that cauſe.</p>
                  <p>He is now put to it, to ſeek peace by the way of wars, and his children being ſhut out of their own, in the way of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, muſt wade in again by way of conqueſt, or ſit out alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>If that part of the afflicted Church, have hope in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate extremity, and truſt in God for deliverance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, they ſhal ſing, <hi>Carmen in nocte:</hi> and let God ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their faith and truſt in him, and let them not think it long to await his leaſure, till he have mercy upon them.</p>

                  <p>And truly, to our underſtanding, it is time for the Lord to put to his hand, for the cauſe is his. The ſtrife was for a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but Religion is ſuch a party in the quarrell, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſhare in the ſufferings of thoſe who fare the worſe for Religions ſake. <hi>Be we comforted in the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore comfort your ſelves in the Lord, God worketh as we ſee againſt the uſurper of <hi>Rome</hi> by his own domeſtiques, and they tell tales of him, and diſcover the nakedneſſe of that proſtitute ſtrumpet to the ſhame of their Religion, he that hath begun, will, alſo in time make an end, and he that begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to loſe eſtimation at home, will hardly either encreaſe or maintein it abroad.</p>
