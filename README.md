1. A Commentarie OR, EXPOSITION UPON The Prophecy of HABAKKƲK.

    _ CHAP. I.

      * Verſe 1. The Burthen which HABAKKUK the Prophet did ſee.

      * Hab. 1.2. O Lord, how long ſhall I cry, and thou wilt not hear; even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not ſave?

      * Verſ. 3. Why doſt thou ſhew me iniquity, and cauſe mee to behold grievance? for ſpoiling, and violence are before me: and there are that raiſe up ſtrife and contention. 4. Therefore the Law is ſlacked, and judgement doth never go forth, for the wicked doth compaſſe about the righteous: therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.

      * Verſ. 5. Be hold yee among the heathen, and regard and wonder marvellouſly: for I will work a work in your days, which you will not believe though it be told you. 6. For lo I raiſe up the Chaldeans that bitter and haſty Nation, which ſhall march through the bredth of the land to poſſeſſe the dwelling places that are not theirs. 7. They are terrible and dreadful, their judgement and their dignity ſhall proceed of themſelves. 8. Their horſes alſo are ſwifter then the Leopards, and more fierce then the evening Wolves: and their horſemen ſhall ſpread themſelves, and their horſemen ſhall come from farre, they ſhall fly as the Eagle that hasteth to eat. 9. They ſhall come all for violence, their faces ſhall ſup up as the Eaſt-wind, and they gather the captivity as the ſand. 10. And they ſhall ſcoffe at the Kings, and the Princes ſhall be a ſcorne unto them: they ſhall deride every ſtrong hold, for they ſhall heap dust and take it. 11 Then ſhall his mind change, and he ſhall paſſe over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his God.

      * Ver. 11. Then ſhall his mind change, and he ſhall paſſe over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.

      * Verſ. 12. Art thou not from everlaſting, O Lord, my God, my holy one? we ſhall not dye O Lord my God, thou haſt ordained them for judgement, and O mighty God, thou haſt eſtabliſted them for correction, 13. Thou art of purer eyes then to behold evill, and canſt not look on iniquity; wherefore lookeſt thou upon them that deal treacherouſly? and holdeſt thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous then he? 14. And makest men as the fiſhes of the ſea, and as the creeping things that have no ruler over them.
15. They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their dragge, therefore they rejoyce and are glad. 16. Therefore they ſacrifice unto their net, and burn incenſe unto their dragge, becauſe by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous. 17. Shall they therefore empty their net, and not ſpare continually to ſlay the nations?

      * Verſ. 1. I will ſtand upon the watch, and ſet me upon the Tower, and will watch to ſee what he will ſay unto me, and what I ſhall anſwer when I an reproved.

      * Verſ. 2. And the Lord anſwered me, and ſaid, Write the viſion, and make it plaine upon Tables, that he may run that readeth it. 3. For the viſion is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak and not lye: though it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry.

      * Verſ. 4. Behold his ſoule which is lifted up is not upright in him: But the just ſhall live by his faith.

      * Verſ. 5. Yea alſo becauſe he tranſgreſſeth by wine, he is a proud man, neither keepeth at home: who enlargeth his deſire as hell, and is as death, and cannot be ſatisfied, but gathereth unto him all Nations, and heapeth unto him all People.

      * Verſ. 6. Shall not all theſe take up a Parable against him, and a taunting Proverb againſt him and ſay: woe to him that increaſeth that which is not his, how long? and to him that ladeth himſelf with thick clay. 7. Shall they not riſe up ſuddenly that ſhall bite thee? and awake that ſhall vexe thee? and thou ſhalt be for booties unto them? 8. Becauſe thou haſt ſpoyled many nations, all the remnant of the people ſhall ſpoyl thee, becauſe of mens blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and all that dwell therein.

      * Verſ. 9. Woe to him that coveteth an evill Covetouſneſſe to his houſe, that he may ſet his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil. 10. Thou haſt conſulted ſhame to thy houſe by cutting off many people, and haſt ſinned againſt thy ſoul. 11. For the ſtone ſhall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber ſhall anſwer it. 12. Woe to him that buildeth a towne with blood, and ſtabliſheth a city by iniquity. 13. Behold, is it not of the Lord of hoaſts, that the people ſhall labour in the very fire, & the people ſhal weary themſelves for very vanity. 14. For the earth ſhal be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the Waters cover the ſea.

      * Verſ. 14. For the earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea.

      * Verſ. 15. Wo to him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him and makeſt him drunk alſo, that thou mayſt look on their nakedneſſe. 16. Thou art filled with ſhame for glory; drink thou alſo and let thy foreskin be uncovered, the Cup of the Lords right hand ſhall be turned unto thee, and ſhameful ſpuing ſhall be on thy glory. 17. For the violence of Lebanon ſhall cover thee, and the ſpoil of beaſts which made them afraid becauſe of mens blood, and for the violence of the Land, of the City, and of all that dwell therein.

      * Verſ. 18. What profiteth the graven Image, that the maker thereof hath graven it? the molten Image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work truſteth therein, to make dumb Idols? 19. Woe unto him that ſaith to the wood, awake; to the dumb ſtone ariſe, it ſhall teach; behold it is laid over with gold and ſilver, and there is no breath at all in the midſt of it. 20. But the Lord is in his holy temple, let all the earth keep ſilence before him.

      * HABAK. 3.1. A Prayer of Habakkuk the Prophet upon Sigionoth.

      * Ver. 2. O Lord, I have heard thy ſpeech and was afraid: O Lord, revive thy work in the middeſt of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.

      * Ver. 3. God came from Teman, and the holy one from mount Paran, Selah. His glorie covered the Heavens, and the Earth was full of his praiſe. 4 And his brightneſs was as the light, he had horus coming out of his hand, and there was the hiding of his power. 5 Before him went the peſtilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.

      * Verſe 6. He ſtood and meaſured the earth, he beheld, and drove in ſunder the Nations, and the everlaſting Mountains were ſcattered; the perpetuall hils did bow: his ways are everlaſting.

      * Ver. 7. I ſaw the Tents of Cuſhan in affliction, and the curtains of the Land of Midian did tremble.

      * Verſe 8. Was the Lord diſpleaſed againſt the rivers? was thine anger againſt the rivers? was thy wrath againſt the ſea? that thou didſt ride upon thy horſes, or thy chariot of Salvation.

      * Verſe 9 Thy bow was made quite naked according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word, Selah.Verſe 9. Thou didſt cleave the earth with rivers.

      * Verſe 10. The mountains ſaw thee, and they trembled, the overflowing of the water paſſed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lift up his hands on high.

      * Verſe 11. The Sun and Moon ſtood ſtill in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, at the ſhining of thy glittring ſpear. 12 Thou didſt march through the Land in indignation, thou didſt threſh the heathen in anger. 13 Thou wenteſt forth for the ſalvation of thy people, even for ſalvation with thine Anointed: thou woundeſt the head out of the houſe of the wicked by diſcovering the foundation to the neck. Selah. 14 Thou doeſt ſtrike through with his ſtaves the head of his villages, they that came out as a whirlwind to ſcatter me, their rejoycing was as to devoure the poor ſecretly.

      * Verſe 14. Thou didſt ſtrike through with his ſtaves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to ſcatter me:Hab. 3.14. there rejoycing was to devour the poor ſecretly.

      * Verſe 15. Thou didſt walk through the ſea,Hab. 3.17. with thine horſes through the heap of great waters.

      * Verſ 16.Hab. •. 6. When I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voice, rottenneſſe entred into my bones, and I trembled in my ſelf, that I might reſt in the day of trouble, when he cometh up unto his people, he will invade them with his troops.

      * Verſe 17. Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſome, neither ſhall fruit be in the vines,H•b. 3.17. the labour of the Olive ſhall fail, and the field ſhall yield no meat, the flocks ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtals.

      * Verſe 18 Yet will I rejoyce in the Lord,H•b 3.18. I will joy in the God of my ſalvation. 19. The Lord God is my ſtrength, and he will make my feet like Hinds feet, and he will make me to walk upon my high places. To the chief ſinger upon my ſtringed Inſtruments.
